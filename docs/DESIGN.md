# Slate — Design Document

A universal firmware for the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7 that renders a native LVGL dashboard from a declarative configuration fetched at runtime.

Core idea: flash once, never compile again. The dashboard is data, not firmware. Visual quality is the system's responsibility, not the user's.

## 0. Motivation

Two projects already occupy this space, and each solves half the problem.

**openHASP** solved the iteration loop — universal firmware, pages pushed over MQTT, no recompilation. But its configuration is a low-level description of LVGL primitives (`{"obj": "btn", "x": 10, "y": 20, "w": 180, "h": 80}`). That gives total freedom and turns every user into a UI designer. Most people aren't, and the results show.

**ESPHome** solved the visual side — full access to LVGL styles, themes, flex and grid layouts. Anything is achievable. But its YAML describes device firmware, so every layout change means validation, compilation and flashing a full image. That is the wrong loop for something you rearrange several times a day.

Slate aims for both: a runtime that accepts a declarative config and a curated set of components that are difficult to make ugly.

### Scope

This is a personal project published as open source. There is no commercial roadmap and no support commitment. Practical consequences:

- "Universal" means that one flashed runtime accepts dashboard configuration and state/actions from more than one automation system. It does not mean arbitrary UI primitives or immediate support for every board.
- Milestones are ordered so a usable panel is on the wall as early as possible. The main risk to a project like this is abandonment, not missing features.
- The maintainer's own dashboard is the first test case. Edge cases surface on real data within the first week rather than in speculation.
- Hardware support is limited to one board. Others may be added only if someone brings the board and is willing to test.

## 1. Architecture decisions

Short ADRs. Each records a decision and its consequence so the discussion doesn't reopen.

### ADR-1: Firmware is fixed, the UI is data

One binary per board model. The UI definition arrives from outside as JSON and is parsed at runtime.

Consequence: no layout can be hardcoded. Every component must be built dynamically from a description and destroyed without leaking memory. This constraint shapes the entire runtime.

### ADR-2: Semantic components, not primitives

Configuration says `"type": "light"`, not "a button 180×80 with a label".

Consequence: improving a component in firmware improves every user's dashboard without touching their configuration. The design system ships over OTA, which makes OTA critical infrastructure rather than a convenience.

Second consequence: anything not anticipated cannot be built. This is intentional.

### ADR-3: Integrations are providers behind a neutral core

The UI runtime does not know Home Assistant, MQTT or any other automation protocol. It consumes normalized resource state and emits semantic actions through a narrow provider interface. The bundled `direct` provider, the Home Assistant provider, the Shelly provider and the Tuya cloud provider implement that interface.

Consequence: a component asks to `toggle` a light; it never constructs a Home Assistant `call_service` frame. Adding another system means writing an adapter, not forking the component library or the configuration parser. Home Assistant is the first production integration, not a runtime dependency.

Integrations still terminate on the device. The browser talks exclusively to the device, and provider credentials remain there. The Home Assistant token never passes through the browser after initial entry. CORS is configured on the device, where we have control, and the editor works with no backend of any kind.

### ADR-4: The device API is a public contract

Rather than requiring a Home Assistant add-on, the device exposes a documented, versioned API. The bundled editor is its first client, not its only one.

Consequence: anyone can build an alternative frontend, generate configuration from a script, write a CLI, or integrate a system other than Home Assistant. A HACS integration is a later convenience layer, never a dependency.

### ADR-5: The screen is the preview

There is no second renderer. The editor shows an abstract grid for arranging tiles; the result is viewed on the device in edit mode.

Consequence: preview divergence is impossible by construction. No Emscripten build, no pixel-parity maintenance, no duplicated font pipeline. A remote mirror (framebuffer snapshot) is deferred — see section 15.

### ADR-6: Assets are compiled into the firmware

A curated set of icons and fonts ships in the binary. Nothing is fetched over HTTP.

Consequence: no asset versioning, cache invalidation or flash management. New icons arrive via OTA alongside the components that need them.

```

The direct provider is the smallest useful interoperability path: a script or Node-RED flow publishes normalized state over HTTP and receives semantic actions over the device WebSocket. It needs no broker, cloud service or companion process. Home Assistant uses an in-firmware adapter because its compressed subscriptions and service calls are valuable enough to support directly.

The two arrows above point in opposite directions and the third points outward: `direct` is pushed to, `ha` is a connection the panel opens to one system that owns the house, and `shelly` (§5.9) and `onkyo` (§5.10) are the panel reaching individual devices itself. Only the last pair makes a panel standalone — with nothing else on the network running, the tiles still carry values and still answer a tap.

Those two are also not the same shape as each other, which is the point of having both. `shelly` asks and waits; `onkyo` holds a socket open and is told. A provider boundary that carried only pollers would be a polling engine with an interface on it.

## 3. Configuration format

### 3.1 Principles

- JSON, UTF-8, versioned via the `schema` field.
- Describes intent, not appearance.
- Unknown fields are ignored (forward compatibility).
- An unknown component type renders a placeholder tile, never a crash.
- Size limit: 64 KB.

### 3.2 Grid

The display is 800×480. A fixed 56 px system bar at the top has 16 px outer
margins and twelve gapless 64 px slots. The optional top-level `bar` array
places non-interactive items with a zero-based `slot` and a `span`: `clock`,
`title`, `page_indicator`, a provider `badge`, or a component name carrying a
binding. Items may not overlap or extend beyond slot 11. A badge names its
`provider` and may override its caption with `label`; its dot uses the theme
accent while online, warning while connecting or degraded, and muted colour
while offline or unconfigured.

A bar item named `sensor`, `light` or `cover` carries §3.3's `provider` and
`resource` pair and shows that resource's state over its name: for a sensor the
reading and its unit, or the word a textual one reports — §5.6's `binary_sensor`
door contact is that case and is how a door reaches the bar; `On`/`Off` for a
light; `Open`/`Closed` or the reported position for a cover. Those last two also
carry the badge's dot, accent while the light is on or the cover is open and
muted otherwise; a sensor has no dot, having no second state to colour it with.
Naming the component rather than inventing a kindless bound item is what
supplies §5.1 with the kind every binding is handed to the store with — the same
answer a tile keeps in the same place — and it is why a `scene`, which is
stateless and could only ever render blank, is a validation error on the bar
rather than an item reserving slots. `label` overrides the caption, which
otherwise falls back to the normalized name and then to the resource id (§7). A
bound item needs at least two slots, because one 64 px slot holds a caption or a
reading and not both.
Unavailability is §7.5's: the dash, not the last value, and — on the two kinds
that carry one — the warning colour on the dot. A sensor has none, so the dash
is the whole signal.

Omitting `bar` preserves the schema-1 compatible arrangement: clock, current
page title, connection status and, on multi-page dashboards, an exact
current/total page number. An explicit empty array makes the bar blank. Unknown
bar item types reserve their declared slots but render empty, so a document
from newer firmware degrades without rearranging its known items. The page
indicator is empty for a single-page dashboard in either arrangement.

A component name is never an unknown type, and adding the bound items narrowed
what schema 1 accepts: a `scene` in the bar, and a bound item in a single slot,
were previously unknown items reserving space and are now validation errors.
Forward compatibility is a promise about vocabulary this firmware has not
learned yet, not about a name it understands and knows cannot render.

A horizontal swipe inside the content area moves one page left or right without
wrapping at either end. A single-page dashboard has no position indicator. When
a configuration is replaced, the visible page stays selected if its `id` still
exists; otherwise the new document's `home_page` is selected.

The content area is 800×424, divided into a 4 × 3 grid with a 12 px gap and 14 px margin. Each cell is 184×124 px — enough for an icon, a value and a label, with room for a comfortable touch target.

The grid can represent tile sizes 1×1, 2×1, 1×2, 2×2 and 4×1. A
known component accepts only the variants listed in section 7; for example, a
4×1 light is invalid even though that rectangle fits the grid. An unknown
component type may use any grid-level size and renders the forward-compatible
placeholder from section 3.1.

Position is `[column, row]`. Pixel coordinates do not exist in the format.

Twelve cells is also the performance answer, not only a layout choice: S-2 measured a saturated page at 66 % of the frame budget at p95, and the same scene on a 5 × 4 grid at 98 % at the worst frame. Widening the grid would therefore spend what is left of the budget as well as invalidating every existing configuration.

            {"provider": "ha", "resource": "scene.away"}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Fields common to every tile: `id`, `type`, `pos`, `size`, plus optional `label` (overrides the normalized resource name) and `icon` (overrides the component default). Where a component variant renders an icon, the override is a stable Material Design Icons name from `tools/fonts/icons.txt`, such as `fire` or `thermometer-low`; a name unavailable in the running firmware renders the broken-image placeholder instead of an empty glyph.

Page ids are unique within the document. Tile ids are also unique across the
whole document, not merely within one page, because they key validation errors
and editor selection. Empty ids are invalid.

Most tiles carry one `binding`; a component such as the scene bar carries `bindings`. A system-bar item named after a component (§3.2) carries the same pair as two fields on the item itself, having no tile to hang an object off. A binding is always the pair `provider` + `resource`. Resource ids are opaque outside their provider: `light.living_room` has meaning to the HA adapter, while `living-room` may name the same light in the direct provider. The pair is stored and compared as two strings; firmware never infers a provider from punctuation or from a component type.

Provider ids are at most 15 UTF-8 bytes and resource ids at most 63. The same
pair may feed several tiles and bar items only when all known component types
agree on its normalized kind; binding `direct:living-room` as both a `light`
and a `sensor` is invalid whether the disagreement is between two tiles or
between a tile and the bar. One active configuration may reference at most 256
distinct pairs.
Unknown component types do not reserve provider state until firmware learns
how to interpret them.

The provider owns the mapping between its native data and the semantic type named by the component. A `light` tile therefore renders an incompatible-binding placeholder if its resource arrives with normalized kind `sensor`, but neither the parser nor the component needs to know how that mismatch was represented upstream. A malformed binding is a validation error; an unknown provider id is accepted and renders a missing-provider placeholder, preserving forward compatibility with configurations created on newer firmware.

`timezone` is a IANA zone name mapped to a POSIX TZ string in firmware; the clock and the night schedule depend on it. `screen_off_after` is in minutes; `0` means never.

### 3.4 Migration

The firmware supports schema versions up to N. A newer configuration is rejected with a "firmware update required" screen, and the previously active configuration stays live. This version check is contractual from schema 1.

Upgrading older configurations (an in-firmware migrator that rewrites and persists) is only needed once a schema 2 exists, and is deferred until then — see section 15. What is not deferred: every schema change must ship with its migrator, so old configurations keep working without hand-editing.

## 4. Device API (contract v1)

Base: `http://<ip>/api/v1`. `/info` and `/session` are the public browser bootstrap; every other route requires the in-memory device-session credential unless the route explicitly accepts a scoped External API key.

### 4.1 HTTP

| Method | Path               | Description |
|--------|--------------------|-------------|
| GET    | `/info`            | model, firmware version, `schema_max`, name, available themes, authentication mode, current network state. No auth. |
| POST   | `/session`         | open an editor session with the optional administrator PIN; returns the internal bearer credential to the current page only |
| GET    | `/config`          | current UI configuration |
| PUT    | `/config`          | replace configuration; validates, rebuilds the UI, persists. With `?transient=1` (edit mode only) the rebuild happens in RAM and nothing is written to flash — this is what live preview uses, so a drag session does not wear the flash. |
| POST   | `/config/validate` | validate without saving — `204` when valid, detailed `400` when invalid |
| GET    | `/providers`       | available providers: id, status and resource count |
| GET    | `/resources?provider=<id>` | normalized resources available from one provider; used by the picker |
| POST   | `/direct/state`    | publish one normalized resource snapshot through the External API (`direct`) provider; accepts a scoped integration key |
| GET    | `/ha`              | whether HA is configured and its URL; never returns the token |
| POST   | `/ha`              | configure the HA provider; connection is tested before saving |
| DELETE | `/ha`              | disconnect HA and erase its URL and token |
| GET    | `/ha/discover`     | discover local HA instances over mDNS; manual URL entry remains available |
| POST   | `/ha/catalog`      | start one editor-only HA catalog relay stage (`entities`, `devices`, `areas` or `states`); returns a request id |
| GET    | `/ha/catalog?request=<id>` | poll and consume the raw HA result for one catalog relay stage |
| GET    | `/tuya`            | whether the Tuya cloud provider is configured; the region and account uid, never the Access ID or Secret |
| POST   | `/tuya`            | configure the Tuya cloud provider; credentials are validated against the Tuya cloud before saving |
| DELETE | `/tuya`            | disconnect the Tuya provider and erase its credentials |
| GET    | `/integration-keys` | list non-secret External API key metadata |
| POST   | `/integration-keys` | create a named External API key; the plaintext is returned once |
| DELETE | `/integration-keys?id=<id>` | revoke one External API key and close active integration WebSockets |
| GET    | `/wifi/scan`       | nearby networks: `ssid`, `rssi`, `channel`, `auth`. Cached — see section 9.2 |
| POST   | `/wifi`            | set station credentials and, optionally, IPv4 addressing, setup-access-point password and administrator PIN; persist, then apply. Answers before the result is known (section 9.3) |
| DELETE | `/wifi`            | forget the credentials and raise the setup access point |
| GET    | `/status`          | network and provider states, RSSI, uptime, free heap, LVGL heap and fragmentation, reset reason, reboot counter, resource count |
| POST   | `/mode`            | `{"mode": "normal"\|"edit"}` |
| POST   | `/identify`        | flashes the screen — for telling panels apart |
| POST   | `/ota/upload`      | development OTA; raw `.bin` body (section 11.1) |
| GET    | `/update`          | release channel state: running version, offered release, last check (section 11.4) |
| POST   | `/update/check`    | check the manifest now instead of waiting for the daily check |
| POST   | `/update/install`  | install the offered release and restart; the body names the version being accepted |
| POST   | `/update/settings` | `{"scheduled": true\|false}` — whether the panel makes the daily check at all |
| GET    | `/coredump`        | last core dump, if any |
| POST   | `/factory_reset`   | wipes NVS and LittleFS |

`POST /config/validate` has no ambiguous success state: a valid configuration
returns `204 No Content`, while an invalid one returns `400 Bad Request`. There
is no `200 {"valid": false}` response. Validation does not change the active or
stored configuration.

`GET /config` returns the raw active configuration document. While a transient
preview is active, that is the in-memory preview; otherwise it is the persisted
document. It returns `404 not_found` when neither exists.

`PUT /config` returns `204 No Content` after a successful replacement. It first
validates the complete document, then atomically replaces the LVGL tree and all
provider subscriptions. A regular replacement is persisted only after that
activation succeeds; a transient replacement requires edit mode and never
writes flash. Leaving edit mode discards a RAM-only transient replacement and
restores the persisted presentation and subscription set. Semantic touch
actions remain suppressed until that restoration completes, so a tile that
exists only in the outgoing preview cannot act during the transition. When
persistence fails after activation, the submitted document remains the active
in-memory configuration and the previous persisted document is preserved for
the next boot. Every activated replacement publishes a `reloaded` WebSocket
event, even when its subsequent persistence fails. Transient requests outside
edit mode return `409 edit_mode_required`; any query other than the exact
`?transient=1` returns `400 invalid_query`; activation and persistence failures
return `500 apply_failed` and `500 store_failed`, respectively.

The three device controls return `204 No Content` on success. `POST /mode`
accepts a JSON object whose `mode` is `"normal"` or `"edit"`; edit mode has the
same 60-second inactivity fallback as a WebSocket-owned edit session. Its
refusals are `empty_body`, `invalid_json`,
`too_large` (`413`), `invalid_mode` and `mode_unavailable` (`503`).
`POST /identify` and `POST /factory_reset` have no request body and refuse one
with `unexpected_body`. Identify can also return `503 display_unavailable`.
A successful factory reset erases NVS and LittleFS, issues a new device token,
answers, and then reboots; an incomplete best-effort reset returns
`500 reset_failed` and still reboots into the only supported post-reset state.
A concurrent reset request returns `409 reset_in_progress`.

`POST /wifi` accepts an optional `setup_password` alongside the station
credentials. Omitting it preserves the recovery network's current security;
an empty string makes that network open, and a non-empty value must contain
8–63 characters. The setup page keeps this setting behind an advanced
disclosure because an open recovery network is the residential default (§9.2).

Document-wide errors and errors belonging to an identifiable tile are kept
separate. `tile_errors` is keyed by `tile.id`, and each value is an array because
one tile may violate more than one rule:

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_config",
  "config_errors": [
    {"code": "home_page_not_found", "path": "/home_page"}
  ],
  "tile_errors": {
    "living-room": [
      {"code": "tile_overlap", "path": "/pages/0/tiles/2/pos"},
      {"code": "invalid_size", "path": "/pages/0/tiles/2/size"}
    ]
  }
}
```

`path` is a JSON Pointer into the submitted document. Codes and paths are the
public machine-readable contract; firmware does not return presentation text,
so the editor can localize it. The schema-1 validation vocabulary is
`schema_required`, `schema_invalid`, `schema_too_new`, `theme_required`,
`theme_not_found`, `bar_required`, `bar_item_required`, `bar_slot_invalid`,
`bar_span_invalid`, `bar_overlap`, `pages_required`, `duplicate_page_id`,
`home_page_not_found`, `tile_id_required`, `duplicate_tile_id`,
`invalid_position`, `invalid_size`, `tile_out_of_bounds`, `tile_overlap`,
`binding_required`, `provider_required` and `resource_required`. A tile without
an id and a duplicate tile id are document-wide errors because neither has an
unambiguous `tile.id` bucket. Unknown fields, component types, bar item types
and provider ids retain section 3's forward-compatible behavior and are not
validation errors.
`provider_required` and `resource_required` also cover a wrong JSON type, an
empty string or the length limits from section 3.3. `binding_required` also
covers reuse of one provider/resource pair by conflicting known component
kinds and exceeding the 256-resource bound.

An empty body and malformed JSON return the standard `400` documents
`{"error":"empty_body"}` and `{"error":"invalid_json"}`. A body above the
64 KB limit returns `413 {"error":"too_large"}`, and an allocation failure
returns `500 {"error":"out_of_memory"}`. `PUT /config` uses the same detailed
`invalid_config` document on validation failure, leaving the current UI and
subscriptions untouched.

Network state appears in `/info` as well as `/status`, because a browser that has just joined the setup access point has no token and still has to know what it is looking at:

```json
{"network": {"mode": "ap", "ssid": "slate-a1b2c3", "ip": "192.168.4.1", "sta_ssid": null,
             "ipv4": {"mode": "dhcp", "static": null}, "last_error": "bad_password"}}
```

`mode` is `sta` or `ap`; `ssid` is the network the device is currently on or offering; `sta_ssid` is the configured station network, which exists even while the access point is up. `last_error` is the reason the station is not connected, and it is the same string the setup screen prints — one vocabulary, so a report from the panel and a report from the API cannot disagree.

`ipv4.mode` is where the station's address came from, and it is reported rather than echoed: after a static configuration fails and the device falls back (section 9.6) the mode here is `dhcp`, because that is what the address on the screen actually is. A field that repeated the request instead would make the setup page show a number meaning two different things.

`ipv4.static` is the other half of that, and it is the stored configuration rather than the live one — what was asked for, and what became of it. It is `null` on a panel that has never been given one:

```json
{"ipv4": {"mode": "dhcp",
          "static": {"state": "gateway_unreachable", "address": "192.168.1.42/24",
                     "gateway": "192.168.1.1", "dns": ["192.168.1.1"]}}}
```

`state` is `pending`, `confirmed`, `gateway_unreachable` or `address_in_use` — section 9.6's trial, before and after. The last two are the case the two fields exist to describe together: the mode says `dhcp` because that is the address the panel is answering on, and `static` says what was typed, so the setup page can put it back in the form with the reason above it. A page that could see only the mode would have nothing to pre-fill and would be asking somebody to retype an address they have already typed once.

`address` carries its prefix, in the same CIDR form `POST /wifi` accepts, so what comes out of this endpoint can be sent straight back into that one.

The same object is what `POST /wifi` accepts:

```json
{"ssid": "home", "password": "...", "ipv4": {"mode": "dhcp"}}

{"ssid": "home", "password": "...",
 "ipv4": {"mode": "static", "address": "192.168.1.42/24",
          "gateway": "192.168.1.1", "dns": ["192.168.1.1"]}}
```

An absent or `null` `password` preserves the stored passphrase only when `ssid`
is unchanged. That is the recovery path: the setup page can correct a failed
static address without receiving or asking for the secret that remains in NVS.
For a different SSID there is no matching secret to preserve, so an absent
password means an open network. An explicit empty string always means open and
erases the stored passphrase, including when a router keeps its SSID while its
security changes.

An absent `ipv4` means `dhcp`. That default is what makes the field addable without a version — section 3.1's rule that unknown fields are ignored points the same way for a client written against a firmware that predates it. A request that says `dhcp` is a request to *stop* using a stored static address, not merely one that declines to set one: the stored configuration is erased, which is what makes the setup page's addressing control able to undo itself.

A static configuration submitted here is always on trial, whatever state a previous one reached. Section 9.6's stickiness is a property of a configuration that has proved itself, and something that has just been typed has not.

`POST /wifi` answers `202`, because the status has to say what the body cannot: the credentials are stored and are being applied, and section 9.3 is why the outcome is not knowable here. With a static address the gap is wider than it looks — the `202` says the configuration is stored, and section 9.6 may have reverted it fifteen seconds later. Its refusals are `400` unless noted: `empty_body`, `invalid_json`, `truncated`, `too_large` (`413`), `ssid_required`, `ssid_too_long`, `password_too_long`, `bad_ipv4`, `bad_ipv4_mode`, `bad_address`, `bad_gateway`, `bad_dns`, and `store_failed` (`500`). The addressing is validated whichever mode is asked for, so an address sent alongside `"dhcp"` is refused rather than quietly ignored.

A gateway must be a different host on the address's subnet. The subnet's network and broadcast addresses, and the panel's own address, are refused as `bad_gateway`: all three are valid dotted quads, but none can answer the ARP proof section 9.6 requires.

`GET /wifi/scan` serves the cache of section 9.2 and says how old it is. `age_s` is `null` when no sweep has been taken, which is a different thing from a room with no networks in it:

```json
{"networks": [{"ssid": "home", "rssi": -54, "channel": 6, "auth": "wpa2"}], "age_s": 12}
```

`auth` is `open`, `wep`, `wpa`, `wpa2`, `wpa3`, `enterprise` or `unknown` — the question a person picking a network is being asked is whether it wants a passphrase, not which key exchange it prefers. `?rescan=1` sweeps again before answering, and is the section 9.2 refresh button rather than something a client polls: the sweep makes the access point unresponsive while it runs.

The complete M1 response shapes are:

```json
{
  "model": "waveshare-s3-touch-7",
  "firmware_version": "1.0.0",
  "schema_max": 1,
  "name": "slate-a1b2c3",
  "themes": [],
  "authentication": "pin",
  "network": {"mode": "sta", "ssid": "home", "ip": "192.168.1.42", "sta_ssid": "home",
              "ipv4": {"mode": "dhcp"}, "last_error": null}
}
```

`themes` lists capabilities present in this firmware rather than work planned for a later milestone. The first capability is `midnight`; later theme ids appear only in firmware that actually contains their tokens and assets. `authentication` is `pin` when a new editor session needs the administrator PIN and `open` when anyone on the LAN may open one.

```json
{
  "network": {"mode": "sta", "ssid": "home", "ip": "192.168.1.42", "sta_ssid": "home",
              "ipv4": {"mode": "dhcp"}, "last_error": null},
  "providers": [
    {"id": "direct", "status": "degraded", "resource_count": 0},
    {"id": "ha", "status": "unconfigured", "resource_count": 0}
  ],
  "rssi": -54,
  "uptime_s": 120,
  "heap_free": 294631,
  "lvgl_heap_free": null,
  "lvgl_heap_total": null,
  "lvgl_frag_pct": null,
  "reset_reason": "power_on",
  "reboot_count": 3,
  "resource_count": 0,
  "storage_reset": false
}
```

Provider `status` is `unconfigured`, `connecting`, `online`, `degraded`, `offline` or `error`. `unconfigured` is valid for providers that need credentials; `offline` is a transient loss that marks its resources stale; `error` needs user intervention. `degraded` means a provider can still serve part of its contract and does not blanket-stale its resources. The always-present direct provider is `degraded` while it can accept state but has no attached WebSocket action consumer, and `online` while one is attached. `resource_count` at the top is the number of distinct normalized resources held by the store, not the sum of provider catalogs, which may contain resources the active dashboard never references. The three LVGL values are numbers once the LVGL allocator exists and `null` before display bring-up or when it is unavailable; reporting zero would look like a completely exhausted allocator. `reset_reason` uses stable lowercase names rather than exposing ESP-IDF enum values. `storage_reset` says that boot recovery erased corrupt NVS or reformatted LittleFS, which is different from a factory-fresh empty store even though both may have no configuration.

`GET /coredump` is the one route whose success is not JSON. It answers `200 application/octet-stream` with the core dump exactly as the panic handler wrote it to flash — ESP-IDF's header, the ELF, and the trailing checksum — which is what `esp-coredump --core-format raw` reads and also what `idf.py coredump-info` pulls over a cable. One artifact for both transports rather than one per transport. Its refusals are §4's `{"error": "..."}`: `no_coredump` (`404`) when nothing has crashed since the partition was last erased, `corrupt_coredump` (`500`) when a dump is present and fails its checksum, `coredump_read_failed` (`500`) when flash or the partition table will not cooperate, and `out_of_memory` (`500`).

`no_coredump` and `corrupt_coredump` are separate answers because they are opposite news: one is a healthy panel, the other is a crash whose record cannot be believed — and S-3 watched ESP-IDF log "Core dump has been saved to flash" three lines after the write had failed, which is precisely the lie a client must not be handed as a body. There is deliberately no `DELETE`: a panic overwrites the partition rather than appending to it, so nothing accumulates, and a `GET` that does not consume the dump is one that can be retried when the first attempt crosses a weak WiFi link.

A transfer that stops part-way is the one outcome with no error document, because the `200` has already gone. It is a chunked response abandoned without its terminating chunk, which is what tells a client the file is incomplete; the device also gives up on its own after 300 s, so a link too slow to finish cannot hold the API past the health deadline of section 11.2. A short body is therefore always a failed transfer and never a short dump — the distinction matters, because the alternative is `espcoredump` deciding the panel is confused when it was the network.

### 4.2 WebSocket `/api/v1/ws`

Event channel for the editor, remote diagnostics and External API actions. The HTTP upgrade does not carry a
credential: putting it in the WebSocket query string would expose it to browser history and access
logs, while requiring an `Authorization` header would exclude the browser WebSocket API. The
client therefore authenticates with its first text frame, within five seconds of the upgrade:

```json
{"type": "auth", "token": "<32-character session or External API credential>"}
```

Success is `{"type":"auth_ok"}`. A device-session credential is followed by the retained log backlog and a current `status` frame and may use editor controls. A scoped External API key receives only direct-provider actions and may send `ping`, `provider_attach` for `direct`, and `action_result`; it cannot receive logs or status, enter edit mode, or attach another provider. A malformed first frame or a wrong token receives `{"type":"auth_invalid"}` and a
WebSocket policy-violation close (1008). The same close is sent if no first frame arrives within
five seconds. No other application frame is accepted before `auth_ok`.

An External API client that wants to receive direct-provider actions attaches after authentication;
only one such client may be attached at a time, so two processes cannot both operate the same light.

Device → client:

```json
{"type": "status",   "providers": {"direct": "online", "ha": "unconfigured"}, "wifi": -54,
                       "heap_free": 142000, "lvgl_heap_free": 2088632, "lvgl_frag_pct": 1}
{"type": "log",      "level": "warn", "msg": "resource direct:living-room unavailable"}
{"type": "reloaded", "schema": 1, "tiles": 7}
{"type": "action",   "id": 42, "provider": "direct", "resource": "living-room", "action": "toggle", "params": {}}
```

Client → device:

```json
{"type": "ping"}
{"type": "mode", "mode": "edit"}
{"type": "provider_attach", "provider": "direct"}
{"type": "action_result", "id": 42, "success": true}
```

The device sends `status` as its heartbeat every 15 s. The client sends the JSON `ping` above;
WebSocket control ping/pong remains a transport mechanism and has no application semantics.
No client ping for 60 s while in edit mode returns the device to normal. Missing pings do not
disconnect a diagnostics client that is otherwise still connected. A failed `action_result`
reverts immediately; a successful one only acknowledges delivery. A matching state snapshot is
the confirmation that clears the pending presentation, because a command accepted by an
integration is not necessarily a physical state change.

### 4.3 Authentication

The person configuring WiFi may set an optional 4–12 digit administrator PIN. With a PIN, every newly opened or refreshed editor asks for it; without one, anyone on the same LAN can open the editor. The PIN is stored only as a randomly salted PBKDF2-SHA256 hash. Five failed attempts block new attempts for 30 seconds. Changing the PIN setting rotates the internal credential and ends existing sessions. A forgotten PIN is recovered by the panel's physical factory-reset gesture.

Internally, a 32-character random device token still protects the HTTP API and WebSocket. `POST /session` checks the PIN, or accepts an empty request in open mode, and returns that token to the current page. The editor keeps it only in memory: it is never shown to the user, put in a URL or stored in `localStorage`. A new token is issued after `factory_reset`.

Scripts and Node-RED never receive that administrator credential. The editor can create up to four named External API keys. Their 32-character plaintext is returned once; NVS stores only a SHA-256 digest and non-secret id/name metadata. Each key is individually revocable and is accepted only for `POST /direct/state` and the direct action-consumer WebSocket role. Revocation closes active External API WebSockets immediately. Existing device-session credentials remain accepted on those two paths for backwards compatibility and development tools.

The QR on the panel contains only `http://<ip>/`. The device also advertises itself over mDNS as `slate-<mac6>.local`; the editor falls back to it when the remembered IP stops answering, and the new origin starts a new session. mDNS is advertised on the setup access point too, so the same name works before the panel has ever joined a network.

While the setup access point is up, the setup page and the endpoints it needs — `GET /wifi/scan`, `POST /wifi`, `GET /info` — are served **without a token, on the access point interface only**. Everything else answers 401 there. Someone within radio range can therefore move the panel to a different network and choose its future PIN; they cannot read provider credentials, publish direct-provider state, write a dashboard or upload firmware. Setting the optional WPA2 setup-network password narrows that exposure in shared buildings.

## 5. Provider integrations

### 5.1 Provider boundary

A provider is the adapter between one upstream system and the runtime. Version 1 has five provider ids: `direct`, which is always present; `ha`, which is present but `unconfigured` until it has credentials; `shelly` (§5.9) and `onkyo` (§5.10), each present and `unconfigured` until a dashboard binds a device to it; and `tuya`, which is present but `unconfigured` until its Tuya cloud credentials are entered. The common core knows only five operations:

1. report lifecycle status;
2. accept the set of resource ids referenced by the active configuration;
3. deliver normalized resource snapshots or diffs into the state store;
4. accept a semantic action request from the action bus;
5. report whether that request failed or was accepted while a later state update confirms the result.

Provider callbacks post work onto the UI task's queue; they never touch LVGL. Provider-native payloads are parsed and discarded at the adapter boundary. In particular, an HA entity object or `call_service` frame cannot appear in a component header.

The active configuration is the memory bound. After validation, firmware groups bindings by provider and replaces each provider's subscription set atomically with the UI tree. A provider may discover more resources for the editor, but the runtime state store holds only resources referenced by the active configuration. Removing the last binding removes the state on the same rebuild.

### 5.2 Normalized resources and state

Every snapshot has common identity and presentation fields plus kind-specific state:

```json
{
  "provider": "direct",
  "resource": "living-room",
  "kind": "light",
  "name": "Living room",
  "area": "Downstairs",
  "available": true,
  "state": {"power": "on", "brightness": 62},
  "capabilities": {
    "toggle": true,
    "set_power": true,
    "set_brightness": {"min": 0, "max": 100}
  }
}
```

`provider`, `resource`, `kind`, `available` and `state` are required. `name`, `area` and `capabilities` are optional; absent capabilities mean read-only. A complete snapshot replaces the previous one. Internal diffs are allowed between an adapter and the store, but the store always exposes a complete current value to components.

`kind` is semantic, not the native upstream domain. Version 1 defines the shapes needed by the component library:

- `light`: `state.power` is `on` or `off`; optional `brightness` and `color_temperature` exist only with matching capabilities.
- `cover`: position and movement state; actions are `toggle`, `open`, `stop` and `close` when advertised.
- `sensor`: numeric or textual `value`, optional `unit`, optional `measurement` such as `temperature`, `humidity`, `pressure` or `power`, and optional `category`.
- `scene`: stateless; the only action is `activate`.

A sensor carries two independent descriptions of itself because it is asked two questions. `measurement` says what magnitude the number is and decides how §7.3 formats it; `category` says what the reading is about and decides which icon sits beside it. They are separate fields rather than one because a whole class of resource has the second and not the first — a door contact reports a word, measures nothing, and its Home Assistant `device_class` names what it *means*. Folding `door` into `measurement` would have made `{"value": 21.4, "unit": "°C", "measurement": "door"}` a snapshot with nothing wrong with it.

The categories are `temperature`, `humidity`, `pressure`, `power`, `illuminance`, `air_quality`, `gas`, `sound`, `speed`, `battery`, `connectivity`, `door`, `window`, `garage`, `motion`, `occupancy`, `moisture`, `smoke`, `lock`, `plug`, `problem` and `running`. The list is bounded by what §7.3 can draw rather than by what a provider might want to say: a category is a glyph, so two things the panel renders identically are one category, and a category with no glyph would be a distinction with no consequence. It stays provider-neutral for the same reason `measurement` does — a `direct` script says `moisture` in its own words and gets the same icon an HA leak detector gets.

The four measurements are also categories, spelled the same because they mean the same thing, and a measurement implies its category: a provider that sets only `measurement` gets the matching `category` filled in by the store, so nothing that reads a snapshot has to derive it a second time. A category the provider stated is never overwritten — it is the more specific of the two, which is how a battery percentage reads as a battery rather than as a bare number.

Unknown state fields and capabilities are ignored. An unavailable resource keeps its last known values but renders stale; a resource that has never produced a snapshot renders the missing placeholder from §7.5. A provider becoming `offline` marks only that provider's resources stale — an unavailable HA instance must not dim tiles supplied by `direct`. `degraded` does not imply stale: a read-only direct sensor remains fresh even when no action consumer is attached.

`GET /providers` returns the same provider entries used in `/status`, without unrelated device health:

```json
{"providers": [
  {"id": "direct", "status": "degraded", "resource_count": 2},
  {"id": "ha", "status": "unconfigured", "resource_count": 0}
]}
```

`GET /resources?provider=<id>` returns this normalized vocabulary for the picker as `{"resources":[...]}`. `direct` lists only resources already referenced and published since boot. Home Assistant discovery uses the editor-only relay in §5.7 because assembling its full catalog on the ESP32 would consume memory in proportion to the whole HA instance. A provider-specific detail may be added under an `extensions` object namespaced by provider, but components and the generic picker cannot depend on it. Missing, unknown and unconfigured provider queries return `400 provider_required`, `404 provider_not_found` and `409 provider_unconfigured` respectively.

### 5.3 Actions and optimistic state

Components emit semantic actions against their binding:

```json
{"id": 42, "provider": "direct", "resource": "living-room",
 "action": "set_brightness", "params": {"value": 40}}
```

The action bus validates the action against the resource capabilities and routes it to the selected provider. Transport names are not semantic action names: `set_brightness` may become an HA `light.turn_on`, an MQTT publish in a future adapter or a WebSocket event in the direct provider.

Optimistic updates are mandatory. A valid action immediately applies its expected normalized state and marks the tile pending with a subtle pulse. A matching real state update confirms it. Explicit failure or no confirmation within 3 s reverts to the last confirmed state and shows a brief error. A provider reporting success means only that it accepted the request; it does not confirm physical state. Late confirmations become ordinary state updates, duplicate results are ignored, and a real update that disagrees with the optimistic value wins immediately.

### 5.4 External API (`direct`) provider

The stable provider id is `direct`; the user-facing editor calls it **External API** so its transport direction is not mistaken for a generic HTTP polling engine. It makes the neutral contract usable without Home Assistant and proves that provider neutrality is more than a mock. A script or Node-RED flow binds a resource in the editor, publishes the dashboard, then publishes complete snapshots for that resource id:

```http
POST /api/v1/direct/state
Authorization: Bearer <external_api_key>
Content-Type: application/json
```

The body is the snapshot from §5.2 without `provider`, which is fixed to `direct` by the endpoint:

```json
{"resource":"living-room","kind":"light","name":"Living room","available":true,
 "state":{"power":"on","brightness":62},
 "capabilities":{"toggle":true,"set_brightness":{"min":0,"max":100}}}
```

After validation and enqueueing, the endpoint returns `202 {"resource":"living-room"}`. Publishing an id not referenced by the active configuration returns `404 resource_not_bound`; this prevents an unbounded LAN client from filling PSRAM. A kind different from the active component binding returns `409 kind_mismatch`. Malformed common or kind-specific state returns `400 invalid_state`. None disturbs the last confirmed value.

To receive actions, one authenticated device-WebSocket client sends `{"type":"provider_attach","provider":"direct"}`. A second attachment receives `{"type":"error","error":"provider_busy"}`. An attachment that names no provider, or one this firmware does not implement, is refused in the same shape with §5.2's `provider_required` and `provider_not_found` — the question is the same one `GET /resources` asks, so the answer keeps the same name rather than growing a second vocabulary for the WebSocket. Re-attaching is not an error for the client that already holds the attachment; the rule is that two processes cannot both operate the same light, and a repeat from the one that holds it is not a second process. There is deliberately no acknowledgement frame: attaching moves the provider from `degraded` to `online`, so the `status` frame that follows carries the fact a consumer was asking about. The device then sends the `action` event from §4.2. `action_result` with `success:false` and an optional stable `error` string reverts immediately; `success:true` acknowledges delivery, and the next published snapshot confirms state. If the attached client disconnects, the provider becomes `degraded`: published state remains valid, while new actions fail immediately rather than waiting three seconds.

This path deliberately has no broker, callback URL, persistence, arbitrary HTTP polling or discovery protocol. The Integrations view explains the direction, creates/revokes scoped keys and gives a concrete publish example. A future REST polling source is a separate provider because intervals, HTTP credentials, JSON selection and transformation are a different contract rather than options on this one. MQTT is likewise added only when a real integration needs it.

### 5.5 Home Assistant connection

The HA provider uses Home Assistant's WebSocket API at `/api/websocket`, authenticated with a long-lived access token from the user profile. The token should belong to a dedicated account in the `system-users` group — see §12, which says why that group specifically and not the read-only one.

The device discovers local instances through Home Assistant's
`_home-assistant._tcp.local.` service. `GET /ha/discover` returns the advertised
`location_name`, `uuid` and `internal_url` as `name`, `uuid` and `url`; `uuid`
is empty if a non-conforming advertisement omits it rather than being replaced
with a hostname that is not the instance identity. An empty result is valid
because multicast DNS may not cross a VLAN. The editor fills the URL from a
sole result or offers a choice when several answer. It
always sends an explicit `url` together with the token to `POST /ha`, and manual
entry remains the fallback for routed networks and instances that do not
advertise an internal URL. Firmware never chooses an arbitrary instance.

`POST /ha` accepts `{"url":"http://homeassistant.local:8123","token":"..."}`
and returns `204 No Content` only after an `auth_ok` test and atomic persistence.
Shape failures are `400` with `empty_body`, `invalid_json`, `url_required`,
`token_required`, `url_too_long`, `token_too_long` or `bad_url`; upstream
authentication and reachability failures are `422 ha_auth_invalid` and
`502 ha_unreachable`; an oversized body is `413 too_large`, and persistence
failure is `500 store_failed`. Existing
credentials and the live connection remain unchanged on every failed request.
The credential test runs outside the HTTP server task, and any WebSocket HTTP
redirect is refused before Slate sends the token; the configured URL is the
credential boundary, not merely the first hop toward one.
A full configuration-work queue returns `503 ha_busy`, and an unexpected
manager handoff failure after persistence returns `500 reload_failed`.

`GET /ha` returns `{"configured":true,"url":"..."}` or the same shape with
`configured:false` and a null URL. It never returns the token. `DELETE /ha`
erases both values, tears down the live connection and returns `204`.

Reconnect with exponential backoff: 1 s → 2 → 4 → 8 → 15 → 30 s (ceiling). `auth_invalid` is not retried forever: it moves the provider to `error` until credentials change. A network or HA restart moves it through `offline` and `connecting` while the last confirmed states remain visible as stale.

### 5.6 Home Assistant state mapping

Use `subscribe_entities` with the explicit HA entity ids in the HA provider's subscription set — never the full instance state. It returns compressed diffs, which keeps bandwidth and parsing cost negligible at typical dashboard sizes. The adapter expands those diffs, maps HA domains, states and attributes into §5.2, and only then updates the common store.

Re-subscription follows any successful `PUT /config` that changes the HA binding set and every reconnect. With no HA bindings, firmware deliberately sends no subscription: Home Assistant treats a missing or empty `entity_ids` filter as the full instance. The existing UI tree does not care why a fresh snapshot arrived.

Five HA domains map onto §5.2's four kinds. An entity in any other domain is not normalized and never reaches the store, so the editor's picker does not offer it either:

| HA domain | `kind` | `available` when the raw state is |
|---|---|---|
| `light` | `light` | `on` or `off` |
| `cover` | `cover` | `open`, `closed`, `opening`, `closing` or `stopped` |
| `sensor` | `sensor` | anything but `unavailable` |
| `binary_sensor` | `sensor` | `on` or `off` |
| `scene` | `scene` | anything but `unavailable` |

`binary_sensor` is a `sensor` whose `value` is a word, not a fifth kind and not a `light`. The on/off shape would fit `light`, but §5.2 gives `light` a `toggle` and a `set_power` that a door contact cannot honour, and naming a read-only contact a light to borrow its dot is a lie the action bus would have to keep. Normalizing it to `sensor` needs no new vocabulary and renders in §7.3 today, since a sensor's value is already "numeric or textual" — and, for the same reason, on §3.2's bound bar item, which is where a door contact earns its place without spending a cell of the grid.

The word comes from `device_class`, which is where a `binary_sensor` keeps its meaning, and the words are Home Assistant's own, so the panel says what the app the user came from says. `On`/`Off` is the fallback for an absent or unrecognised class. `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` carries the table; the adapter's self-test asserts one class per distinct phrasing, so changing a word is a visible change to a test.

The same `device_class` also supplies §5.2's `category`, which is what puts a door rather than a question mark beside the word. One table serves both sensor domains, because the class names are one namespace and a `battery` is a battery whether it arrives as `41` or as `Low`; several classes share a category wherever the panel draws them the same way. A numeric `sensor` therefore gains an icon for the classes outside §5.2's four measurements — `illuminance`, `battery`, `aqi` and the rest — which used to reach §7.3 with nothing to choose from. A class this firmware has no glyph for supplies no category and falls back to the question mark, which is the honest answer for one entity rather than the rule for a domain.

The category does not depend on the state, because `device_class` is an attribute and not a state. A contact whose first observed state is `unknown` — a panel that came up before its Zigbee integration did, a sensor whose battery died before anyone bound it — is unavailable and renders §7.5's dash, and is still drawn as a door. Taking the icon away with the value would put the question mark back exactly where it was worst.

`unknown` is not `off`. A `sensor` may legitimately read `unknown` and §7.3 shows that text; a `binary_sensor` that says so has not answered, so it goes unavailable and renders §7.5's dash rather than a word that is not true. That is why the table above keys availability on the domain and not on the kind.

### 5.7 Home Assistant resource picker

Opening the HA picker makes the browser request four relay stages in sequence: `config/entity_registry/list_for_display`, `config/device_registry/list`, `config/area_registry/list` and `get_states`. None needs an administrator — S-4 measured the underlying registry reads from a `system-users` and a `system-read-only` token and got payloads byte-identical to the administrator's. Only mutating registry commands are gated. `list_for_display` is used instead of the full entity registry: on the measured instance it was 83 KB rather than 635 KB and had already removed disabled entities that cannot back a tile.

For each stage, `POST /ha/catalog` queues one command on the existing authenticated HA WebSocket and returns `202 {"request":N}`. The browser polls `GET /ha/catalog?request=N`: pending work remains `202`, success returns the original HA result frame, and reading the result consumes it. Only one stage may be in flight, and an unconsumed stage expires after 30 seconds. The relay is deliberately narrow: callers select one of four fixed commands and cannot use it as a generic authenticated HA proxy.

Firmware reassembles each WebSocket message into a PSRAM buffer but treats a catalog result as opaque JSON: it reads only the top-level command id, hands the raw response to HTTP, and neither builds a cJSON tree nor retains a normalized catalog. The browser owns the four decoded payloads, joins them and creates the provider-neutral picker entries. The normalized `name` comes from the already-composed `friendly_name` in live state, not from the sparse registry name fields. This discovery fetch is deliberately broader than the runtime subscription in §5.6: it happens on demand while configuring, not at connection time or continuously.

The picker degrades on **failure, not on privilege**: the browser falls back when a registry stage fails, for whatever reason — an older or unusual instance, a transport error, a future Home Assistant that tightens this. It does not predict a permission in advance. `get_states` is required and still yields a flat normalized list with no `area`, so registry failure changes grouping rather than the picker vocabulary.

This path must be implemented, not assumed away — and it is needed more often than that reads. On the instance S-4 measured, 63 % of registry entries resolve to no area at all, so the flat ungrouped list is what the picker shows for the majority of a real installation regardless of permissions. It is a first-class presentation, not an error state, and the editor (§10) must make it look deliberate.

HA `area` resolves through the **device**, not usually the entity:

```
entity_registry.area_id
  ?? device_registry[entity.device_id].area_id
  → area_registry[area_id].name
```

Zero of 1 045 entities on the measured instance carried `area_id` directly; all 387 area assignments came from the device. Omitting the device registry therefore produces a null normalized `area` for every entity and looks like a generic-picker bug.

Catalog data is never written to NVS and is not cached by firmware. During configuration, the browser holds one assembled catalog for the editor session while the panel holds at most one raw HA result in PSRAM. Every tile picker reuses that browser cache immediately; after five minutes it may start one deduplicated refresh in the background, without making the picker wait. Reconfiguring or disconnecting HA invalidates the cache. After the editor closes, the browser catalog disappears and the firmware stores only the dashboard's selected ids; §5.6 then requests small state diffs for exactly those ids. The registry, device and state payloads together are hundreds of kilobytes on the wire and several times that once parsed, which is precisely why the join belongs in the browser.

### 5.8 Home Assistant action mapping

The HA provider maps semantic actions to service calls. For example, light `toggle` becomes:

```json
{"id": 42, "type": "call_service", "domain": "light", "service": "toggle",
 "target": {"entity_id": "light.living_room"}}
```

`set_brightness` becomes `light.turn_on` with `brightness_pct`; cover actions and scene `activate` map similarly. HA result ids remain inside the adapter. A failed result is passed to the common action bus, while confirmation comes from the normalized state update produced by the subscription. A read-only HA account returns `home_assistant_error` with message `Unauthorized`, not the `unauthorized` code, so the adapter must preserve that distinction when reporting the useful failure.

### 5.9 Shelly provider

The first adapter that reaches a device by itself. `direct` waits to be pushed to and `ha` needs an automation system in the middle; `shelly` polls relays over HTTP on the LAN, which makes a panel with no companion process anywhere show live state and answer a tap. That is the property it exists for: a dashboard fed by `direct` goes to dashes the moment its feeder stops, and a wall panel that depends on a laptop being awake is not one.

**Its configuration is the binding set.** §5.1's second core operation already hands a provider the resource ids the active dashboard references, so this adapter spends §3.3's "resource ids are opaque outside their provider" on carrying the address:

```json
{"provider": "shelly", "resource": "192.168.1.51/switch:0"}
{"provider": "shelly", "resource": "shelly1-abcdef123456.local/switch:0"}
```

The grammar is `<host>/<role>:<index>`, where `role` is `switch`, `power`, `voltage` or `temperature`. There is no `POST /shelly`, no NVS entry and no picker to fill in before the first tile works, and a dashboard exported to another panel takes its devices with it. What it costs is DHCP: a lease that moves breaks a binding, and the answer is a reservation or the mDNS name above. The alternative was a second copy of the device list that has to be kept in step with the one already in the document, which is the failure this avoids rather than a cost it pays.

**Generations are discovered, not configured.** `switch:0` is a switch on a Plus 2PM and on a Shelly 1; `GET /shelly` answers on both and carries `gen` only on the newer one, so the adapter probes a host and then uses `/rpc/Switch.*` or `/relay/N`. Nobody writing a dashboard should have to know which generation is in which ceiling. The probe is repeated whenever a device stops answering, because "the same address" and "the same device" are not the same claim: a relay replaced with a newer model keeps the binding and changes the dialect.

**One task owns everything with a socket in it, and it owns the device tables outright.** §6.1 keeps LVGL on a single task, so a poller blocking on a relay that takes 267 ms to answer cannot hold up a frame. The action bus's dispatch callback does not make the HTTP call either: it queues the command and returns, which is what §5.3 means by "returning ESP_OK only acknowledges that the adapter took responsibility for reporting a later result". The command is carried out on the poller, which then re-reads that device rather than waiting out the interval — §5.3 makes the snapshot, not the acknowledgement, the thing that clears a tile.

The subscription path is where that discipline is easiest to lose and matters most. §5.1 calls `subscribe()` on the binding task, which is §6.4's UI task, and both it and the poller run at priority 4 — so a lock this adapter held across a sweep would freeze the screen and the touch panel for as long as the timeouts lasted, which is the exact failure the threading above exists to prevent, reintroduced through the back door. `subscribe()` therefore builds the replacement tables on its own stack and hands them over through a lock held for a few pointer moves; the poller adopts them at the top of its next pass. Correctness does not depend on the wake-up, only latency does.

**Two timeouts, because they answer to different deadlines.** A sweep races the next sweep; a command races §5.3's three-second revert, after which the bus discards a late result and the relay switches after the tile has already said it did not. Both are 2 s, and a sweep is abandoned as soon as a command arrives, so a tap on a reachable relay lands inside the deadline even while another device is timing out. Two unreachable devices in a row can still exceed it — and there the action has genuinely failed, so reverting is the right outcome rather than a wrong one.

`toggle` is one request in both dialects (`Switch.Toggle`, `/relay/N?turn=toggle`) rather than a read followed by an inverted write, which cannot race a reading taken between the two.

**A reading that was never taken is not published.** §5.2's snapshot has no spelling for "no value" — a sensor carries a finite number or a non-empty word, and the store refuses anything else — so a binding whose device has never answered, or whose role that device does not measure, keeps §3.3's placeholder naming `provider:resource` instead. That is the accurate rendering, and the alternative was a refused publication repeating every five seconds for the life of the binding. Once a value has arrived, an unreachable device publishes it again with `available: false`, which is §5.2's "keeps its last values and renders stale"; a dash therefore means a resource that had a value and lost it, and a placeholder means one that never had one.

**What it deliberately does not have.** No authentication: these devices ship open on a LAN, and a password-protected one needs credential storage, which is §4.3's problem and not this adapter's until such a device exists. No discovery catalog for the editor's picker — `GET /resources` returns the bound set, and mDNS discovery is the natural next step rather than a prerequisite. No shared polling service either: a second HTTP-polled provider would be the first evidence of what two such adapters have in common, and there is one.

**Its status is about the relays, not about the radio.** A station and a binding set are not evidence that anything is being served, and saying `online` on the strength of those two made a dashboard of four wrong addresses indistinguishable from a working one — with `GET /resources` unable to correct the impression, since a resource with no reading is not published at all. The five states §5.2 already has are enough: `connecting` before any device has had its first turn, `online` when every one answered, `degraded` when some did, `offline` when none do now but some have, and `error` when none ever has, which is the one that needs a person.

The cost is the argument for the provider boundary. `libslate_shelly.a` measures **about 4 KB**, a hundred-odd bytes of it internal SRAM, against roughly 20 KB for the Home Assistant adapter — because `esp_http_client` is already linked for the release channel and cJSON for the configuration parser. `idf.py size-components` on a release build is where those come from, and they are given to one significant figure on purpose: the claim is that an integration is cheap once its transport is in the image, and that claim does not need four digits that go stale every time somebody touches the component.

### 5.10 Onkyo provider

The second adapter that reaches a device by itself, and the first that does not poll. eISCP is a small binary frame over TCP 60128 with no credential in it, and a receiver **announces itself**: turn the volume knob on the front panel and an `MVL` frame arrives unasked. So this adapter holds the socket open and publishes what comes, asking outright once per connection and then once a minute as a safety net.

That is why it was built second rather than instead. §5.9 proved the provider boundary carries a poller, and §5.1's five operations say nothing about who speaks first — but a boundary that had only ever carried pollers would not have been evidence of much. This one exercises the other direction and needed no change to the core to do it.

**The same configuration story as §5.9.** The binding carries the address, so there is nothing else to set up:

```json
{"provider": "onkyo", "resource": "192.168.1.60/main"}
{"provider": "onkyo", "resource": "192.168.1.60/input:2b"}
```

`main` is the receiver as a `light`, `input` is the selected input as a `sensor`, `input:<code>` is a `scene` that selects one, and `mute` is a `scene` that toggles. `<code>` is eISCP's own selector byte — `2b` for NET, `24` for FM — rather than a name this firmware would have to keep in step with a vocabulary it does not own.

**A receiver is published as a `light`.** §5.2 has four kinds and none of them is an amplifier. `light` is the one whose shape fits — a thing that is on or off with one continuous level — and mapping volume onto `brightness` is what gets §7.1's slider instead of a row of blind step buttons. The tile wants to be 2×1 rather than 2×2 — both draw the slider, but §7.1's 2×2 variant captions it `BRIGHTNESS` and adds a colour-temperature row, and a component talking about lights is the one thing this mapping cannot afford on screen. It carries `icon: volume-high` so the screen does not claim it is a lamp. A media-player component is §15's, and when it exists this adapter changes its `kind` and nothing else; that it can is the argument for ADR-3 rather than a workaround for it.

Volume is sent as the percentage itself, one for one. A TX-8270 answers `MVL56` — 86 — while its own `NRI` reports `volmax="82"`, so the two are not the same number and neither is reliably the scale; a receiver clamps what it cannot do, and a predictable mapping is worth more than a guessed one. The consequence is worth stating rather than leaving to be discovered: the slider is an absolute volume with no ceiling of its own, and dragging it to the top asks for the loudest thing the receiver can do.

**A connection attempt is bounded by hand.** `SO_SNDTIMEO` does not apply to `connect()` — lwIP consults it only on the send path — so a blocking connect is bounded by SYN retransmission, which at this project's `CONFIG_LWIP_TCP_SYNMAXRTX` of 12 is minutes rather than seconds. That is not merely slow: the task is not in `select()` or reading its queue while it runs, so one unplugged receiver would deafen the adapter to a tap meant for a working one. The attempt is therefore non-blocking and joins the `select()` the loop already performs.

**Nothing is published before the receiver has answered once.** §5.2 has no spelling for "not told yet", and a light defaulting to off would be a claim rather than an absence — the same question §5.9 settled the same way, and the tile keeps §3.3's placeholder until the first frame arrives.

**Frames are a stream, not messages.** The reader consumes only what has fully arrived, resynchronises on `ISCP` rather than trusting the buffer to begin on a boundary, and skips a frame too large to hold — an `NRI` answer is kilobytes of XML this adapter never asks for. On a quiet LAN these frames arrive whole every time, which is exactly why the split-read case is in the self-test rather than left to a day when it does not.

## 6. Firmware

### 6.1 Stack

ESP-IDF 5.x, LVGL 9.3+, `esp_lcd` with an RGB panel, GT911 over I²C, CH422G as IO expander, `esp_websocket_client` inside the HA provider, `esp_http_server` for the device/direct-provider API and for the setup page, `esp_wifi` in station and SoftAP modes with a small DNS responder for the captive portal (§9.2), cJSON for configuration, SNTP for time (the system bar clock and the night schedule are meaningless without it).

All LVGL access happens on one task; API handlers and every provider post normalized work to it through a queue rather than touching the tree directly.

### 6.2 Memory budget

- Framebuffer 800×480 RGB565 = 750 KB in PSRAM. **Two of them**, in LVGL's direct render mode, measured in S-2. The deciding figure is not tearing but internal SRAM: rendering straight into the PSRAM framebuffers needs no internal draw buffer, which returns **77 832 B** of the scarce memory in exchange for 750 KB of the abundant kind. Tearing with a single framebuffer was measurable at 5.8–11.2 torn frames per second and never visible on the panel, so it is not what buys the second buffer.
- The flush waits for VSYNC. Not an optimisation: without it the panel flickers visibly on anything that moves, because the RGB driver applies a framebuffer switch only at a frame boundary, and rendering faster than the panel scans then discards frames. Gating produces exactly one rendered frame per scan-out.
- Bounce buffer in internal SRAM — required, otherwise WiFi activity causes visible artifacts. The artifact is worth naming, because no counter on the CPU side shows it: the picture rolls vertically, with the bottom of the screen appearing at the top. That is the DMA losing its race to read the framebuffer out of PSRAM while the radio and the renderer compete for the same bus. S-2 measured frames as 4 % *cheaper* without the bounce buffer, and the display unusable.
- LVGL draw buffer: ~1/10 screen, internal SRAM — but only in a single-framebuffer configuration, which is not the one above. LVGL wants two such buffers so rendering and flushing overlap, and 2 × 76 800 B does not fit: S-2 measured 104 167 B of internal DMA-capable memory free once WiFi is up. Size any internal draw buffer from what is actually free after `esp_wifi_start()`, not from the screen.
- LVGL heap: 2 MB in PSRAM — the entire widget tree budget. Deliberate headroom rather than a measured requirement: S-1 measured 12.2 KB for a ten-tile page and 18.5 KB at peak across a whole run, well under 1 % of it. It does no harm on 8 MB of PSRAM, but anyone sizing memory here or meeting PSRAM pressure later should know the widget tree is not where it goes.
- State store: sized from the configuration, ~256 B per bound resource plus kind-specific state. Even a config saturating the 64 KB limit stays in the tens of KB. During HA discovery, one opaque WebSocket result may temporarily occupy PSRAM; the browser, not the panel, owns the assembled catalog.
- Configuration: ≤64 KB, parsed into structs then freed.
- The setup access point (§9) costs internal SRAM where there is least of it. S-2 measured 104 167 B of internal DMA-capable memory free with the station alone; `WIFI_MODE_APSTA` adds a second interface's buffers on top. It is raised on demand and torn down as soon as the station associates, never left running as a permanent second interface. `APSTA` is the intended mode and §9.4 depends on it: the station must keep trying while the access point is up, which is what lets an unattended panel recover on its own. If it does not fit, that is a budget problem to solve — not a behaviour to drop; §9.4 names the degraded shape it may not fall below.

### 6.3 Partition table

The target module is the **ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8**: 16 MB of quad flash and 8 MB of octal PSRAM. That is what the board reads out of the silicon — flash JEDEC device id `0x4018` — rather than what the vendor documentation describes, which claims N8R8. Boards with 8 MB of flash are welcome to work, but they are not a goal and the table below does not fit one.

The layout lives in `firmware/partitions.csv`:

| Partition  | Type / subtype         | Offset   | Size |
|------------|------------------------|---------:|-----:|
| `nvs`      | data / nvs             | 0x9000   | 80 KB |
| `otadata`  | data / ota             | 0x1D000  | 8 KB |
| `phy_init` | data / phy             | 0x1F000  | 4 KB |
| `ota_0`    | app                    | 0x20000  | 6 MB |
| `ota_1`    | app                    | 0x620000 | 6 MB |
| `littlefs` | data / littlefs (0x83) | 0xC20000 | 3.75 MB |
| `coredump` | data / coredump        | 0xFE0000 | 128 KB |

The sizes follow measurements rather than round numbers:

- **6 MB per application slot.** S-3 measured the skeleton at 1.34 MiB release and 1.48 MiB development (`-Og`), and §11.1 makes the development image the one that travels over the wire daily. That figure is a lower bound — no UI runtime, no component library, no provider implementations, no configuration parser — so the slot is sized for growth rather than for today's image.
- **3.75 MB of LittleFS.** The editor bundle (§10) targets under 400 KB gzipped and a configuration is capped at 64 KB (§3.1). The remainder is room for the deferred asset manager (§15), which would otherwise arrive as a reflash.
- **128 KB of coredump.** An ELF dump of a twelve-task image resembling M1's — WiFi, lwIP, HTTP server, plus the LVGL and provider tasks — measures 21 KB. A dump stores each task's *used* stack, so the ceiling is the sum of the allocated ones: around 50 KB for that task set, and still inside 128 KB once M1 fills them. §11.3 depends on the dump surviving a panic, and a partition that truncates it is worse than no partition at all. #14 measured the real thing across three forced panics in `app_main` at slightly different points in startup: **21 988 B to 26 020 B, 16.8 % to 19.9 % of the partition**, with up to thirteen tasks alive (`main`, both idles, `ipc0`, `ipc1`, `esp_timer`, `sys_evt`, `tiT`, `wifi`, `httpd`, `slate_wifi`, `slate_setup`, `ota_health`) — M1 without the display. The spread is the point: a dump stores each task's used stack, so *when* the panel crashes moves the number, and the ceiling is what the partition has to hold. The estimate above was the right shape.
- **`phy_init` is kept** even though `CONFIG_ESP_PHY_INIT_DATA_IN_PARTITION` is off by default. Four kilobytes now cost nothing; enabling that option later without the partition costs a serial flash.

NVS and LittleFS sit outside the application slots, so configuration and tokens survive an update (§11.4). Changing any of this later forces a full serial flash, which is why the table is settled before firmware code is written.

### 6.4 UI lifecycle

```
load config
  → validate
  → build replacement LVGL tree
  → compute binding sets per provider
  → atomically activate tree + provider subscriptions
  → event loop

PUT /config
  → validate (on error: 400, existing UI untouched)
  → build replacement tree off-screen
  → atomically activate tree + provider subscriptions
  → destroy old tree and unreferenced state
```

Rebuilds must be memory-idempotent. After 500 cycles the free LVGL heap returns to its starting value. This is spike S-1 and a precondition for the whole design.

### 6.5 Modes

| Mode    | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| setup   | the device runs its own access point and serves the setup page. The screen shows the SSID, the password if one is set, the address and a WiFi QR — section 9 |
| normal  | dashboard; touch emits semantic actions for bound resources |
| edit    | top bar reads "edit mode", touch emits no provider actions, live preview of changes |
| offline | one or more providers unreachable: only their tiles are dimmed, indicators identify them, last known values remain visible but clearly stale |
| error   | no configuration or incompatible schema: instructions and device address on screen |

## 7. Component library

Four components at launch. Each has variants driven by tile size.

### 7.1 light

| Size | Content | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1×1  | icon, name, state dot | tap → `toggle` |
| 2×1  | icon, name, brightness %, slider | slider → `set_brightness` |
| 2×2  | large icon, brightness slider, colour temperature if supported | `set_brightness` / `set_color_temperature` |

Reads normalized capabilities and hides controls the resource does not support. HA's `supported_color_modes` is interpreted only by the HA provider.

### 7.2 cover

| Size | Content | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1×1  | position-aware icon, name | tap → `toggle` |
| 1×2  | icon, name, up / stop / down buttons, position % | `open` / `stop` / `close` |
| 2×1  | as above, horizontal | as above |

Movement shows an animated indicator until the state settles.

### 7.3 sensor

| Size | Content |
|------|---------|
| 1×1  | value (large), unit, name (small) |
| 2×1  | as above with a leading icon |
| 2×2  | as above plus a 24 h chart (deferred — see section 15) |

No actions. The normalized `category` selects the icon and the normalized `measurement` selects value formatting; HA `device_class` is one input the HA provider maps onto both. The icon is fixed per category and does not follow the value — a door reads the same glyph whether it says `Open` or `Closed` — because §5.2's sensor state carries a word rather than a boolean, and recovering one by matching §5.6's phrasings back out of English is not a thing a component should do. A reading with neither field renders the question mark.

### 7.4 scene

| Size | Content | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1×1  | icon, name | `activate` |
| 4×1  | bar of 2–5 scenes | as above |

Confirmation is a brief tile flash. Scenes are stateless.

### 7.5 Shared requirements

These determine whether dashboards look good on someone else's data, and are mandatory for every component:

- **Text overflow.** A name that does not fit is ellipsized or marquee-scrolled, never clipped mid-glyph.
- **Out-of-range values.** `1013.25` and `-12.4` must fit where `21.4` was designed for. The type scale steps down automatically for longer strings.
- **Resource unavailable.** `available:false` or an `offline` provider renders dimmed with a dash, not an empty tile.
- **Resource missing.** A binding that has never produced or can no longer resolve a resource shows a placeholder containing `provider:resource`, so it can be located in the editor.
- **Touch targets ≥ 48 px** in both dimensions.
- **Pending state** visible for every action.

## 8. Theming

Appearance derives from tokens. Users choose a theme; they do not set forty colours individually. The accent and its contrasting foreground are part of that theme.

```json
{
  "id": "midnight",
  "bg": "0x101114",
  "surface": "0x1A1C21",
  "surface_alt": "0x22252B",
  "text_hi": "0xF2F5F9",
  "text_lo": "0x8A94A6",
  "accent": "0x6C8CFF",
  "on_accent": "0x101114",
  "warn": "0xF5A524",
  "radius": 18,
  "gap": 12,
  "pad": 14
}
```

`on_accent` is the foreground colour for text and icons rendered on an accent-filled surface.

Two themes at launch: Midnight (dark) and Minimal Light. Themes live in firmware, not in user configuration; `GET /info` lists the available ids so the editor never hardcodes them.

Three type steps: hero 44 px, body 20 px, caption 15 px. Fonts are rendered at `bpp: 4` — without antialiasing everything looks dated regardless of the rest.

The system bar reserves 220 px for provider status so its clock and centred
320 px page title never move. Status is one caption line: unavailable providers
are ordered by severity so the most important entry gets the available width
first, and lower-priority entries use a glyph-safe ellipsis when their combined
summary exceeds the fixed width. Tiles from every affected provider are still
dimmed independently, so truncating the summary never makes stale controls look
live.

Icons: 60–80 Material Design Icons glyphs selected for the component set, compiled as a font. Character coverage: Latin-1 plus Polish diacritics. Wider script support is deferred, but the coverage decision is made during S-3 because it drives flash usage.

## 9. First run and the setup access point

A panel that has never been configured and a panel whose router has gone away look identical from the outside: a screen that is on and a device that answers nothing. Slate treats them as the same state and resolves both the same way — **when the station is not connected, the device raises its own access point and serves a setup page over it.** There is no combination of circumstances in which a powered panel is unreachable, and no failure that is fixed by a USB cable.

This replaces the on-screen WiFi wizard the design originally called for. A phone keyboard beats an LVGL one at typing a WPA2 passphrase, the browser is already required for everything else the panel is configured with, and removing the wizard removes the only reason setup would depend on the touch controller working.

### 9.1 The flow

1. Flash from the browser using ESP Web Tools (Chromium-based browsers).
2. The device boots, finds no credentials in NVS, and comes up in setup mode. The screen shows the access point's SSID, its password if one is set, the address to open, and a `WIFI:` QR that joins the network in one scan.
3. Join `slate-<mac6>` from a phone or laptop and open `http://192.168.4.1`.
4. The setup page lists nearby networks. Pick one, type its password, optionally choose an administrator PIN, and submit.
5. The panel reports the outcome **on its own screen** — see §9.3 for why the browser cannot. On success it shows the station address and a QR containing only that URL; on failure the access point comes back with the reason.
6. Scanning the URL QR, or typing the address, opens the editor. It asks for the PIN when one was configured and opens immediately otherwise.
7. The editor opens Integrations. Home Assistant offers discovery, manual URL and long-lived-token entry and verifies the connection before persisting. External API explains its push-state/action-return direction and creates a named, scoped key.
8. The provider's resource picker populates and the first page can be arranged.

Steps 6–8 are M6 and later. From M1 the setup page carries the WiFi form and nothing else; the editor replaces it on the station interface.

### 9.2 The access point

| | |
|---|---|
| SSID | `slate-<mac6>` — the last three bytes of the base MAC in lowercase hex, the same name as `slate-<mac6>.local` (§4.3) without its `.local` suffix, so one panel is called one thing everywhere |
| Password | **none by default.** WPA2 can be provisioned in a custom build with `SLATE_SETUP_AP_PASSWORD`; there is no runtime setter in API v1. A configured value lives in NVS and is printed on the setup screen next to the SSID. The 8-character floor is the standard's, not ours |
| Address | `192.168.4.1`, the `esp_netif` default, kept because it is the address people already recognise from every other device that does this |
| DHCP | served by the device, which is also the gateway |
| Portal | a DNS responder answering every query with the device address, so phones open the page unprompted |

The row naming the network is one line high and truncates rather than growing; the explanatory rows below it wrap on purpose. The name is always `slate-<mac6>` and fits with room to spare, so this is a constraint on the presentation rather than on any value it is handed today: the field is as long as the standard allows, and a join row that wrapped instead of truncating would be sitting on the passphrase printed under it — the row that a person with no network is reading off the screen.

The setup page is **compiled into the firmware**, not served from LittleFS. It has to work on a device that has never had a filesystem, and LittleFS is what a bad OTA or a first flash is most likely to leave empty. The cost is trivial against the flash S-3 measured — 22.4 % of a 6 MB slot — and the page is a gzipped single file with no external references, targeted under 24 KB.

The captive portal is best-effort and never the only way in. Answering every DNS query is how a captive portal is detected in the first place, so both iOS and Android will label the network as having no internet and offer to leave it. The address is printed on the screen precisely so that offer costs nothing.

Answering the query is half of it. The probe that follows arrives on this server at whatever path the phone asked for — `/hotspot-detect.html` and its equivalents — so an unmatched request that came in on the access point is redirected to the setup page, and the portal sheet opens on the page rather than on a 404. Everything under the API base keeps answering section 4's `{"error": "not_found"}` instead, redirect or not: a client that asked for a route this firmware does not have wants to be told so. The DHCP server also hands out the portal's URL directly (RFC 8910), which is what a client that understands it uses in preference to any of the above.

Scan results are cached from a sweep taken when the access point comes up, not gathered per request: `esp_wifi_scan_start()` on a radio that is also running an access point makes that access point unresponsive for the duration, which a browser mid-request experiences as the panel having crashed. The page has a refresh button that re-scans and says it will take a few seconds, and a field for typing an SSID that the sweep did not find.

### 9.3 `POST /wifi` cannot tell you whether it worked

There is one radio. The access point and the station share it and must sit on the same channel, so at the moment the station associates with the router the access point moves to the router's channel and drops every client attached to it — including the browser that submitted the form, at the exact instant of success. Polling for a result from that browser is not a thing that can be made to work.

So `POST /wifi` answers as soon as the credentials are stored and validated for shape, and the **result is reported on the panel**. This is not a consolation prize for a missing feature; it is the reason the screen shows the address in the first place, and it is why requirement and hardware agree here rather than fighting.

Failures are named, not generic, and the vocabulary is shared with `/info.network.last_error` (§4.1) so the screen and the API cannot tell different stories:

| `last_error` | On screen |
|---|---|
| `bad_password` | Wrong password for `<ssid>` |
| `not_found`    | `<ssid>` is not in range |
| `no_ip`        | Joined `<ssid>` but the router gave no address |
| `auth_timeout` | `<ssid>` did not answer |
| `gateway_unreachable` | Joined `<ssid>` but `192.168.1.1` did not answer |
| `address_in_use` | `192.168.1.42` is already taken on `<ssid>` |

The last two only arise with a static address and are what section 9.6 is for. With DHCP a router that refuses to lease is `no_ip`, and there is no gateway to be wrong about.

After three failed attempts the access point returns on the same SSID with the reason on screen and the credentials still in NVS, so a corrected password is one field, not a re-entry of everything.

### 9.4 When the network goes away later

A router reboot must not tear a working dashboard off the wall and replace it with a setup card. The two cases are deliberately different:

```
cold boot

  └─ credentials

       ├─ back within 5 min ─────────────────► normal; only the bar indicator ever moved
       └─ still down after 5 min ────────────► setup AP raised *alongside* the dashboard
```

In the runtime case the dashboard stays on screen with all network-backed provider values marked stale — the `offline` presentation of §6.5 applies per provider — and the setup details appear as a banner rather than a full-screen card.

**Raising the access point must never stop the station trying.** This is a requirement, not an implementation note, and it is what makes the five minutes above a safe number rather than a gamble. A router that comes back at minute seven has to find the panel waiting for it: the panel returns to normal, the access point is torn down without ceremony, and nobody had to be in the room. Without it the fallback is a trap — the panel survives the outage and then sits on its own access point indefinitely, needing a human for a fault that fixed itself.

The mode is `WIFI_MODE_APSTA`, and §6.2 records what it costs. Should it not fit alongside everything else M1 puts in internal SRAM, the answer is to find the memory, not to drop the retry. The floor — the degraded shape this may not fall below — is an access point that yields the radio back to the station periodically, at most a minute apart, long enough to attempt an association. That drops the setup page's clients for a few seconds each time, which is a bad experience but a recoverable one. A panel that has stopped trying is not recoverable without a person.

Two further consequences that are easy to miss:

- The screen must not blank or dim while setup details are on it. `screen_off_after` and the night schedule (§3.3) are suspended in setup mode, since the whole point of the mode is an address someone can read.
- The OTA health check must not equate health with a station connection — see §11.2, which this changes.

### 9.5 Getting back to setup

`DELETE /api/v1/wifi` forgets the credentials and raises the access point. `POST /factory_reset` does the same and takes the tokens and the configuration with it. From the panel itself: a 10-second press anywhere on the screen. Changing a router must never require reflashing, and after M1 it never requires a cable either.

### 9.6 A static address proves itself before it is kept

Nothing above needs a static address, and most networks never will — a DHCP reservation on the router pins an address without any firmware. A segment without a DHCP server is the case that has no answer at all, and `no_ip` being terminal is that gap showing.

Closing it introduces the one setting that can make a panel unreachable while everything reports success. Association is layer 2 and knows nothing about the address: with a static configuration `IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP` fires as soon as the address is assigned, because nothing was asked of the network. The attempt therefore always succeeds. The timeout that names "associated but never addressed" as `no_ip` becomes unreachable, section 9.4's fallback is keyed on the station *not* connecting and so never raises the access point, and the screen prints an address that answers nothing.

A wrong passphrase costs a minute and names itself. A wrong gateway would cost a trip to the router's admin page — for most people the one device in the house they are least willing to open — or a factory reset, which takes the tokens and the configuration with it in exchange for a typo. That is not a trade this design gets to offer.

So the device proves the configuration before it keeps it, the way network equipment has done it for decades:

- A **freshly submitted** static configuration is applied as pending, not committed.
- After association the gateway is resolved over **ARP, not ICMP**. Gateways that drop pings are common enough that pinging would revert configurations which work. ARP also answers the second question for free: an address already in use replies from the wrong MAC, which is duplicate address detection (RFC 5227) with no extra machinery.
- No confirmation within roughly fifteen seconds reverts to DHCP, keeps the static configuration stored and marked failed, and prints the reason. The panel comes back on the network at an address on the screen, reachable from the browser that is already open.
- If DHCP does not answer either — the DHCP-less segment this feature exists for — that is the existing `no_ip` path and section 9.4 raises the access point. No new terminal state, and no new name in the station state machine.

The trial covers only a configuration that has just been submitted. Once confirmed, a static address is sticky: a router that is down at some later boot is an ordinary retry. Discarding a working address because of a five-minute outage would be a worse bug than the one this section prevents.

The contract is M1 and the implementation is M7, alongside the recovery paths of section 9.5 that stand behind it.

One deviation from RFC 5227, forced by what lwIP exposes and recorded here because it is a real difference. The RFC probes with a sender address of `0.0.0.0` *before* claiming the address; `etharp_request()` always sends the interface's own address as the sender, and `etharp_input()` caches nothing at all while the interface has none, so an answer to such a probe cannot be seen from the application. What the firmware does instead is section 2.4's ongoing detection: claim the address, announce it, and watch for somebody answering for it. The panel therefore holds a possibly-duplicate address for the second or so the check takes — the same exposure a host defending its address already has, and bounded by a revert that is written anyway.

Its other limit is worth stating rather than discovering: an access point doing proxy ARP answers for addresses it does not own, and a free address on such a network reads as `address_in_use`. The panel is still reachable when that happens — it reverts to DHCP and says why — so the failure mode is a refusal to use a static address, not a panel that has gone quiet.

## 10. Editor

Static files served from the device's LittleFS. React with a drag-and-drop grid. No backend, no cloud, no accounts.

Views:

- **Grid** — abstract rectangles labelled with component type and bound resource, resize handles, snapping. It deliberately does not imitate the panel's appearance; the panel does that.
- **Inspector** — properties of the selected tile: type, provider, resource (searchable picker, filtered by area when the provider supplies one), label, icon.
- **Library** — the component set, draggable onto the grid.
- **Top bar** — pages, theme, publish button, device connection indicator.

Saving: while in edit mode the editor sends `PUT /config?transient=1` debounced at 300 ms for live preview — RAM-only, no flash writes. The publish button sends a plain `PUT /config`, which persists. Bundle size target: under 400 KB gzipped.

JSON import and export are required. They protect configurations across reflashes and let people share layouts.

The bundle is one document — the JavaScript and the CSS inlined into a single `index.html` — and it reaches LittleFS from the firmware image rather than from a flashing tool. Nothing else writes that partition: this section's files have no endpoint in section 4.1, and both OTA mechanisms (11.1, 11.4) write an application slot. A bundle that only ever lived on LittleFS would therefore arrive by serial flash — the cable M1 exists to put away — and would then age against the API it talks to, which is exactly what ADR-2 refuses for the component library. So the compressed bundle is linked into the image and written to `/slate/www/index.html.gz` on the first boot that finds a different one stored there, stamped with its own SHA-256 so a later boot writes nothing.

What is served is the file. That keeps this section's meaning: a future asset manager (section 15) or file endpoint can replace the editor without a reflash, and the firmware leaves a replacement alone until the image's own bundle changes. A panel whose filesystem is empty or unwritable serves the copy in the image instead and says so in the boot log — section 9.2's reasoning for the setup page, applied here. The cost is the bundle counted twice, once per application slot and once on LittleFS, which is affordable against 6 MB slots and the 400 KB budget above.

The editor answers `GET /` on every interface except the setup access point, where section 9.2's page answers it. Neither carries a device token, for the reason section 4.3 gives for the setup page: a browser cannot put an `Authorization` header on a navigation, and neither document contains anything the API would not hand to an unauthenticated `/info`. Every request the editor makes afterwards authenticates normally.

## 11. OTA and untethered development

Two distinct things that are frequently conflated. The first is a development tool and lands in M1. The second is a product feature and can wait.

### 11.1 Development OTA (M1)

A single endpoint. No manifest, no versioning, no HTTPS — but the device token still applies, like every write endpoint:

```
POST /api/v1/ota/upload    body: raw .bin
```

`esp_ota_begin` → `esp_ota_write` as the body streams in → `esp_ota_end` → `esp_ota_set_boot_partition` → reboot. Roughly a hundred lines. The host-side script is a `curl --data-binary @build/slate.bin` with the token header.

The answer comes before the reboot, because after it there is nobody left to answer:

```json
{"partition": "ota_1", "bytes": 927040, "version": "1.0.0-3-gd81fdc4"}
```

The 200 is what says the image was accepted and is about to boot; the body carries only what the status cannot, and degrades to `{}` if it cannot be built. There is deliberately no `status` field duplicating the code, and no announced reboot delay — the delay is a constant of the firmware, not a schedule the device can promise. `version` is read out of the image that has just been written, not the one that is running — "did the file I meant to send arrive" is the question a development flash asks, and the panel is the only party that can answer it. `partition` is the slot it went into, which is the only handle a client has on which of the two it is looking at. Failures are §4's `{"error": "..."}` with `empty_body`, `too_large`, `not_an_image`, `pending_verify` (§11.2), `no_ota_partition`, `out_of_memory`, `truncated` or `invalid_image`. No failure changes what the device boots. What a failure can cost is the *other* slot, and the line is `esp_ota_begin`: the first five are refused before it, so a wrong file costs nothing but the upload — the image header is read first, and `Content-Length` is what `esp_ota_begin` erases against rather than the whole slot. `truncated` mid-upload and `invalid_image` come after it, with the target slot already erased. §11.2 depends on that distinction: an interrupted flash leaves no spare image behind it.

From this point the board can hang on a wall while development continues from a desk.

### 11.2 Rollback belongs to the same step

Without rollback, the first firmware that crashes on boot forces the panel off the wall and back onto USB — precisely what OTA was meant to avoid. This is not later hardening; it is a precondition for the scheme to work at all.

`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE=y`. After a new image boots:

- the HTTP server answers `/api/v1/info` within 60 s on whichever interface is up — the station, or the setup access point of §9 → `esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback()`
- otherwise reboot and automatic revert to the previous partition

Health means "I can accept the next OTA", nothing more, and the check must contain nothing else. Two exclusions follow from that and both are load-bearing:

- **Not any provider connection.** If HA, a direct integration or a future provider is down for maintenance, a perfectly good image would be rolled back.
- **Not the station connection.** A device sitting on its own access point with the API answering can be flashed again — `POST /ota/upload` at `192.168.4.1` is the same endpoint. An image that boots while the router happens to be down is not a bad image, and rolling it back would be the same mistake as the first exclusion, arriving through a different door. Rolling back would also be actively wrong: the previous image is no more able to reach a router that is not there, so the device reboots into an identical state having thrown away the newer firmware.

### 11.3 Logs and crashes without a cable

OTA solves flashing but not diagnostics. Without these three, the first boot loop sends you back to USB anyway:

- **Logs over WebSocket** — hook `esp_log_set_vprintf`, keep an 8 KB ring buffer, stream as `{"type": "log"}` on `/api/v1/ws`. Recent lines remain available after reconnect.
- **Core dump to flash** — `CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_ENABLE_TO_FLASH=y` plus `GET /coredump` returning the dump for `espcoredump.py`. `tools/coredump/fetch.sh` is the host side, as `tools/ota/upload.sh` is for §11.1. The `.elf` it symbolicates against has to be the one that *crashed*, which §11.2 makes a real trap: a panicking image is rolled back, so the panel serving the dump is routinely not running the firmware that produced it. The device says which image it was — the boot report names the crashed task, the program counter and the ELF SHA-256 prefix of the image the dump came from, and whether that is the image now running.
- **Reset reason** — `esp_reset_reason()` and a reboot counter in `GET /status`, which immediately distinguishes a panic from a power cut.

### 11.4 Release OTA

Manifest at a stable URL:

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "board": "waveshare-s3-touch-7",
  "url": "https://.../slate-1.2.0.bin",
  "sha256": "...",
  "min_schema": 1
}
```

Checksum verification, a daily check, and installation only on explicit request — a wall panel must not reboot itself mid-evening.

Configuration and tokens must survive updates. They live in NVS and LittleFS, outside the application partitions. Every release is regression-tested for this.

Four routes carry it: `GET /update` is the channel as the panel sees it, `POST /update/check` looks now, `POST /update/install` accepts a named version, and `POST /update/settings` turns the daily check off. The check downloads the manifest and nothing else; a release is offered only when its `board`, `min_schema` and `version` all say it belongs on this panel, and `min_schema` is compared against section 4.1's `schema_max`.

**The daily check is a setting, not only a build knob.** A panel can be built with no channel at all, and that is the right answer for somebody compiling their own firmware — but the browser flasher exists precisely for people who are not, and they would otherwise have no way to stop section 12's one outbound request short of blocking the panel at their router. So it is a device setting in NVS, reached from the editor, defaulting to on: a panel that never learns a fix exists is the other failure, and the install still needs a person either way. It stops the schedule and nothing else — an explicit check is a request somebody made, not a schedule, and it keeps working. It is not part of section 3's configuration document, which section 10 makes something people export and share between panels; whether one wall talks to the internet does not travel with a dashboard. A factory reset erases NVS, so it returns to on with everything else.

**The download is not `esp_https_ota()`, and the reason is the checksum.** That API never exposes the bytes it writes, so the manifest's `sha256` could only be compared after `esp_https_ota_finish()` — which is the call that moves the boot partition. A checksum verified after committing to the image it describes is not a verification, and the window between the two is a power cut away from booting something nobody checked. The download is therefore the loop `esp_https_ota` runs internally — the same `esp_http_client`, the same certificate bundle, `esp_ota_write()` on the far side — with the hash taken over the stream as it passes. `esp_ota_set_boot_partition()` is reached only by an image whose bytes are the bytes the manifest named, and a failure costs the inactive slot, never the running one (section 11.1 draws the same line). The image that does boot starts in `PENDING_VERIFY` and answers to section 11.2 like any other.

Signing is deliberately absent. TLS with the certificate bundle authenticates the channel and the manifest's SHA-256 authenticates the image against it; a detached signature would add a private key to keep and, to be worth anything against a local attacker with the flash in hand, secure boot and a burnt eFuse. That is a separate decision with its own recovery story, not a line in this section.

## 12. Security

Minimal by design — the device sits on a LAN, not on the internet.

- Provider secrets live only in NVS and are never returned by the API. Tuya's non-secret region and account UID may be returned so the editor can show the current connection. The Home Assistant token is the first such secret and carries the account's authority.
- The device token guards administrative endpoints and the full editor WebSocket. It is an internal transport credential obtained by the current editor page through `/session`, never a user-facing recovery secret.
- Named External API keys are stored only as SHA-256 digests, shown once, individually revocable and accepted only for direct-provider state publication and its action-consumer WebSocket role. They cannot read or replace a dashboard, configure HA, receive logs, upload firmware or factory-reset the panel.
- The optional administrator PIN is stored only as a salted PBKDF2-SHA256 hash. Open mode is explicit: anyone who can reach the panel on the LAN can control it. PIN mode rate-limits failed attempts, asks again for every new page session, and uses physical factory reset as recovery.
- Documentation states plainly that a long-lived HA token carries full account privileges, and recommends a dedicated account in Home Assistant's **`system-users`** group. Not `system-admin`, which grants more than Slate needs, and explicitly **not `system-read-only`**, which does not work: S-4 measured that group reading every registry Slate needs while being refused `call_service`, so the panel renders a perfect dashboard on which nothing responds to a tap. The group has to be named, because "restricted" reads like "read-only" to anyone skimming. The failure is also quiet: a denied service call comes back as `home_assistant_error`, not `unauthorized`, so the HA adapter must classify it before the common optimistic update (§5.3) reverts, or every tap fails forever with no hint that the account is the cause.
- The WiFi passphrase written by `POST /wifi` lives in NVS and is never returned by the API, and it never enters the configuration JSON — §10 makes that file something people export, import and share, and a credential does not belong in a document with those properties.
- **The setup access point is open by default**, and its setup page can change WiFi and administrator-PIN settings. The threat model is a room: a WPA2 passphrase can be set when radio range extends into a shared building, and is then displayed on the setup screen beside the SSID.
- No HTTPS on the device. A deliberate trade-off: a self-signed certificate on an ESP32 is a worse experience than its absence on a local network.
- **The release channel (§11.4) is one of the two things the panel talks to outside the LAN — the other is the `tuya` provider's signed requests to the Tuya cloud, sent only while that provider is configured.** Release checks are outbound, daily, and a few hundred bytes of JSON: no identifier, configuration, or credential is sent with a manifest GET. Tuya requests necessarily carry the cloud Access ID and short-lived token to Tuya over verified HTTPS; the Access Secret remains the local HMAC key and is never sent. A build with `SLATE_UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL` empty has no release channel, and `POST /update/settings` can stop its daily check without disabling an intentionally configured Tuya provider.
- **`GET /coredump` (§11.3) returns memory, so it is the one endpoint whose body is not a curated document.** An ELF core dump carries task stacks, which is where a secret is on its way to or from NVS. Three things keep the two rules above true rather than approximately true. The dump is token-gated like every write, with no setup-access-point exception. `CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_CAPTURE_DRAM` stays off, so `.bss`, `.data` and the heap are not in the dump — and the device token, which lives in `.bss`, is therefore not in it either. And the code paths that hold a passphrase or any provider credential on a stack zero it as soon as they are done, for this reason and with this section named at the call site; that is a habit the firmware has to keep, not a property of the endpoint. Enabling `CAPTURE_DRAM` would break the arrangement, which is a second reason it is off.

Origin allow-lists will be added if a concrete scenario requires them.

## 13. Spikes

Four experiments, each cheap, each capable of invalidating or reshaping the design.

### S-1 — Rebuild idempotency (critical)

Build an LVGL tree from JSON, destroy it, repeat 500 times, logging `lv_mem_monitor()`.

Pass: free heap returns to its starting value within 1%, with no downward trend. If it fails: the runtime architecture needs rethinking before anything else proceeds.

Answered in `docs/spikes/s1.md`: **not within 1 % but bit-identical**. Free LVGL heap, live allocation count and fragmentation are the same integers at cycle 500 as at cycle 1 — 0 B of drift, a least-squares slope of 0.0000 B/cycle — over 500 cycles that each build a *different* tree of semantic components with marquee labels and pending-state animations attached, which is the case that actually leaks. A negative control built with a deliberate 64 B per-tile leak drifts −9.9 % at −414 B/cycle, so the zero is a measurement and not a blind spot. ADR-1 and §6.4 stand; nothing needed rethinking before M1.

Two findings outrank the one the spike was asked for. The negative control never moved the ESP heap at all — the leak lived inside LVGL's pre-allocated pool — so a `GET /status` reporting only `heap_free` would have shown a healthy device while the UI heap bled out, which is why §4.1 reports the LVGL heap separately. And the 2 MB budget in §6.2 is overprovisioned by roughly two orders of magnitude: a ten-tile page costs 12.2 KB and peak use across the whole run was 18.5 KB. It does no harm on 8 MB of PSRAM, but the widget tree is not where the memory goes.

### S-2 — Render performance

A saturated page with 4 animated tiles, driven at 10 resource updates per second. Measure frame time and scrolling smoothness.

Pass: no visible stutter when switching pages. Determines: the maximum tile count per page — which cannot be changed later without invalidating existing configurations — and whether a single framebuffer is enough or tearing demands a second one (section 6.2).

Answered in `docs/spikes/s2.md`: **the maximum tile count is the grid**. Twelve tiles — §3.2 saturated — cost 17 443 µs at p95 against a 26 441 µs frame budget, with no frame over budget and nothing visible on the panel. **Two framebuffers**, for the reason recorded in §6.2. The original brief asked for 20 tiles, which §3.2 cannot express, so 20 was measured as an overload on a relaxed 5 × 4 grid rather than reported as a maximum; it reaches 98 % of the budget at the worst frame.

Two findings outrank the ones the spike was asked for, both in §6.2: the draw buffer specified there does not fit once WiFi is running, and LVGL's default 33 ms refresh period beats against this panel's 37.8 Hz and visibly judders — the frame rate has to be set by VSYNC, not by LVGL's timer.

### S-3 — Flash budget

Build a skeleton with LVGL, WebSocket, TLS, the three type steps of §8, the second icon size §7.1 needs, and the icon set — five faces, not two. Measure image size.

Answered in `docs/spikes/s3.md`: 1 409 680 B release, 1 547 600 B development, which is 22.4 % and 24.6 % of the 6 MB application slot in §6.3. The original criterion was a 3 MB slot on 8 MB flash; the board turned out to have 16 MB, so the criterion is recorded as met rather than binding.

### S-4 — Home Assistant registry permissions

Call `config/entity_registry/list` and `config/area_registry/list` with a non-admin token.

Answered in `docs/spikes/s4.md`: the area-aware picker is a primary feature. A `system-users` and a `system-read-only` token both read both registries in full, returning payloads byte-identical to an administrator's, and no release checked back to 2020.12.0 admin-gates a registry `list`. §5.7 and §12 carry the result. Two findings outrank the one the spike was asked for: `area` resolves entity → device → area, so `config/device_registry/list` is mandatory, and `system-read-only` cannot call services, which disqualifies it as the recommended account.

## 14. Milestones

Ordered so that a usable panel is mounted after M3 and everything afterwards improves something already in service. Each milestone ends in a state worth stopping at.

### Phase 1 — working panel

| | Scope | Done when |
|--|-------|-----------|
| M0 | Spikes S-1…S-4 | four written answers; board variant and partition sizes decided |
| M1 | Partition table, LCD, touch, backlight, WiFi station **and setup access point**, SNTP, LittleFS, device token, OTA, rollback, WS logs, core dump | a panel with no credentials opens its own access point and is pointed at a network from a phone; new firmware installs over `curl`; a deliberately broken image rolls back; logs are visible remotely |
| M2 | Provider-neutral config/UI runtime, state store, action bus, light, sensor, one theme, `PUT /config`, direct provider | with no HA configured, a hand-written JSON and direct-provider snapshots pushed from a script rebuild and update the screen; a tap emits a semantic action and confirmation/failure clears or reverts its optimistic state |
| M3 | HA provider: auth, `subscribe_entities` mapping, service-call mapping, reconnect | the same components work against live HA resources without provider-specific UI code; WiFi or HA loss and recovery resumes automatically. The panel goes on the wall. |

The device token is generated in M1, not later: every write endpoint — including development OTA — requires it from the first day the API exists.

The setup access point is in M1 for the same kind of reason and it is not a comfort feature. Without it, M1's WiFi credentials arrive from a build-time configuration, which means the first change of network — a router swapped, an SSID renamed, a panel carried to another room — costs a serial flash. That is the exact failure M1 exists to eliminate, and it would sit in the middle of it until M7.

M1 ends with a literal test: unplug the USB cable and put it away. Everything afterwards happens over the network. Reaching for the cable during M2 for firmware reasons means M1 was not finished — and the network is included in "firmware reasons", which is what the access point buys.

After M2 the core iteration loop exists: edit JSON, push config and state, observe. It proves the product's central claim without Home Assistant and is already faster than the ESPHome cycle. M3 replaces the direct test script with the first production provider and real household data; it does not change the component or configuration architecture.

### Phase 2 — maturing on real data

| | Scope | Done when |
|--|-------|-----------|
| M4 | cover, scene, all size variants, edge cases from 7.5 | a week of daily use with nothing that irritates |
| M5 | Brightness, night schedule, offline mode | nobody in the house complains about night-time glare; restarting one provider does not freeze the panel or stale unrelated tiles |

M5 outranks the editor because a wall panel without a brightness schedule gets unplugged within days.

### Phase 3 — public release

| | Scope | Done when |
|--|-------|-----------|
| M6 | Web editor, provider/resource picker, second theme | someone unfamiliar builds a page without reading the JSON format |
| M7 | Setup screen and portal polish, editor URL QR, optional administrator PIN, error mode, factory reset from the panel, static addressing (9.6) | the section 9 flow works with no cable and no ESP-IDF, for someone who has not read this document |
| M8 | Release OTA with manifest, prebuilt binary, browser flasher, README, enclosure files | someone without ESP-IDF gets a running panel and receives updates |

M0 is a weekend. M1–M3 carry the technical risk. M4–M5 are the bulk of the hours at the lowest risk. M6–M8 are conditional — they determine whether anyone else can use this.

## 15. Deferred

Ordered by when each is likely to become the limiting factor:

- **More components** — thermostat, media player, weather, energy, presence, alarm. Added one at a time as real dashboards demand them.
- **Remote preview** — `lv_snapshot_take()`, downscaled to 400×240 RGB565 (~190 KB), sent over WebSocket, drawn into a `<canvas>`. No second renderer, no WASM.
- **Historical charts** via `history/history_during_period`.
- **Schema migrator** — the version-check contract exists from schema 1 (section 3.4); the upgrade code is written when schema 2 is.
- **HACS integration** — a convenience layer over the same device API, available on all Home Assistant installations (unlike an add-on, which requires HA OS or Supervised).
- **Asset manager** — HTTP-fetched icons and fonts, once the built-in set stops sufficing.
- **Additional boards** — each has different pins, panel and touch controller.

## 16. Open questions

Each entry carries what became of it, because a question that was answered and left standing here reads as one that is still open.

- **Backlight dimming.** On this board the CH422G controls the backlight as a binary output; smooth dimming requires bridging one pin to a GPIO. The firmware should detect both variants: the schedule works in on/off mode unmodified and dims smoothly after the modification, which is documented as optional. **Answered after M5, in [#41](https://github.com/mateuszsikora/slate/issues/41), and answered as "both" rather than as a choice between them.** One word of this entry did not survive: the variant cannot be *detected*. The installer picks the pin the testpad is bridged to, and a pin nobody soldered reads exactly like one somebody did, so it arrives as configuration — `CONFIG_SLATE_BACKLIGHT_PWM` and the pin beside it, off by default. What the entry was actually asking for stands: the schedule is written against `slate_display_backlight_mode()` and works on both boards, the expander output remains the enable in both, and the modification is documented as optional in [`backlight-dimming.md`](backlight-dimming.md). A brightness percentage means what it says on a modified board and remains on-or-off everywhere else, which is what `CONFIGURATION.md` documents.
- **Power and mounting.** **Settled before M3, as this entry intended:** roughly 1 A at 5 V, with a supply and a cable that can deliver it. The failure mode is worth naming because nothing reports it — a thin cable on a long run browns out the backlight before any error appears. The README carries it as a prerequisite rather than a note, since it constrains where the panel can hang and is harder to change than code.
- **Multiple panels.** **Answered except for the editor.** The device name is suffixed with the last three bytes of the base MAC and is one name everywhere — `slate-<mac6>` as the setup access point (§9.2), `slate-<mac6>.local` over mDNS (§4.3) — and `POST /identify` flashes the screen to tell two panels apart (§4.1). Whether the editor manages several panels from one view is still deferred until a second one exists.
