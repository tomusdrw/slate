# Device API reference

Everything that configures or drives a panel goes through this API, including
the editor the panel serves and the direct provider. It is a public contract:
the browser talks to the device and to nothing else, and no cloud service sits
between them — the one outbound exception is the `tuya` provider below, which
the panel itself drives through the Tuya cloud.

This page is what each endpoint answers. [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) §4, §5 and §11
are the same material with the reasoning attached and are the source of truth
where the two disagree. The document these endpoints carry is
[`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md).

## Base and authentication

```
http://<address>/api/v1
```

`<address>` is the panel's IP, or `slate-<mac6>.local` — it advertises itself
over mDNS, including on its own setup access point, so a changed DHCP lease does
not make the panel disappear.

`GET /info` and `POST /session` are the public browser bootstrap. The person
configuring WiFi may choose a 4–12 digit administrator PIN; without one, the
panel is deliberately open to anyone who can reach it on the LAN. Start a
session with one of:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://<address>/api/v1/session
curl -sS -X POST http://<address>/api/v1/session \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"pin":"1234"}'
```

The response is `{"token":"<32-character session credential>"}`. The editor
keeps it only in page memory and sends it on authenticated requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <32-character session credential>
```

It is an internal transport credential, not a recovery secret: it is never
shown to the person, placed in a URL or stored in `localStorage`. A new page or
mDNS-origin move starts a new session and asks for the PIN again. Five failed
PIN attempts return `429 try_later` with `Retry-After: 30`. Changing the PIN or
factory-resetting the panel rotates the credential.

The editor can also create named External API keys. Those keys are accepted
only by `POST /direct/state` and the direct action-consumer WebSocket role; they
cannot administer the panel. Requests without an accepted credential get
`401`.

**One exception, on the setup access point only.** While the panel is offering
its own network, the setup page and the three endpoints it needs —
`GET /wifi/scan`, `POST /wifi`, `GET /info` — answer without a session on that
interface. Everything else answers `401` there exactly as it does on the
station, so somebody in radio range can move the panel to another network and
cannot read credentials, publish state, write a configuration or upload
firmware.

## Errors

Failures are `{"error": "<stable code>"}` with a matching status. Codes are the
contract; the panel returns no presentation text. The ones that can arrive from
any endpoint that takes a body are `empty_body`, `invalid_json`, `too_large`
(413) and `out_of_memory` (500).

### `GET /info`

One of the endpoints a browser can reach before it has a session, which is why it
carries the network state as well as the identity.

```json
{
  "model": "waveshare-s3-touch-7",
  "firmware_version": "1.0.0",
  "schema_max": 1,
  "name": "slate-a1b2c3",
  "themes": ["midnight", "minimal-light"],
  "authentication": "pin",
  "network": {"mode": "sta", "ssid": "home", "ip": "192.168.1.42",
              "sta_ssid": "home", "ipv4": {"mode": "dhcp"}, "last_error": null}
}
```

`themes` is what this firmware actually carries. `authentication` is `pin` or
`open`; it tells a new editor whether it should show the PIN prompt before
calling `/session`.

`network.mode` is `sta` or `ap`. `ssid` is the network the panel is on or
offering, `sta_ssid` the one it is configured for — which exists even while the
setup access point is up. `last_error` is why the station is not connected, in
the same vocabulary the screen prints: `bad_password`, `not_found`, `no_ip`,
`auth_timeout`, `gateway_unreachable`, `address_in_use`.

`ipv4.mode` is where the current address came from and is reported rather than
echoed: after a static configuration fails and the panel falls back, this says
`dhcp`, because that is what the address on the screen is. `ipv4.static` is the
stored configuration and what became of it — `state` is `pending`, `confirmed`,
`gateway_unreachable` or `address_in_use` — so a setup page can put a failed
address back in the form with the reason above it.

### `GET`, `PUT` and validate `/config`

`GET` returns the raw active document, which is the transient preview while one
is active and the persisted document otherwise, or `404 not_found` when neither
exists.

`PUT` returns `204` once the document has been validated, the screen and every
provider subscription have been swapped atomically, and the result has been
persisted. `?transient=1` requires edit mode and rebuilds in RAM only, which is
what live preview uses so that a drag session does not wear the flash; leaving
edit mode discards it. Refusals: `invalid_config` (400, with the detail
documented in [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md#validation-errors)),
`edit_mode_required` (409), `invalid_query` (400), `apply_failed` and
`store_failed` (500).

`POST /config/validate` answers `204` or the same `invalid_config` document, and
never changes anything.

### Providers and `GET /resources`

Provider state arrives as part of `GET /status`, and as `status` frames on the
WebSocket:

```json
{"providers": [
  {"id": "direct", "status": "degraded", "resource_count": 2},
  {"id": "ha", "status": "error", "reason": "auth", "resource_count": 0},
  {"id": "shelly", "status": "online", "resource_count": 8},
  {"id": "onkyo", "status": "online", "resource_count": 4}
]}
```

Provider entries may include `reason` while a provider is in an actionable
error state. Tuya uses the stable values `auth` for rejected credentials and
`quota` for a missing or expired cloud plan. The field is omitted on recovery
and for providers that have no more specific diagnosis.

The list is every provider this firmware registered, in registration order,
rather than a fixed set — an adapter a later firmware adds appears here without
a change to this contract. `direct` and `ha` are always present, `ha` as
`unconfigured` until it has credentials.

The four ids version 1 carries:

| `id` | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `direct` | published to over `POST /direct/state`; needs a process outside the panel |
| `ha` | one connection the panel opens to Home Assistant |
| `shelly` | the panel polling Shelly relays on the LAN by itself; needs nothing else running |
| `onkyo` | the panel holding a socket open to an eISCP receiver, which pushes its own changes |
| `tuya` | the panel driving Tuya and Smart Life devices through the Tuya cloud; needs a cloud project, and its traffic leaves the LAN |

`status` is `unconfigured`, `connecting`, `online`, `degraded`, `offline` or
`error`. `degraded` means a provider can still serve part of its contract
without staling its resources — the direct provider is `degraded` while it can
accept state but has no WebSocket consumer attached to answer actions.

`shelly` uses the vocabulary to say how many of its relays it is actually
reaching, which is the question a dashboard of addresses raises:

| `status` | Means |
|----------|-------|
| `unconfigured` | no dashboard binds a Shelly; there is no integration to report on |
| `connecting` | bound, but no device has been asked yet |
| `online` | every bound device answered the last time it was asked |
| `degraded` | some did — the rest keep their last values |
| `offline` | none answer now, though some have; the station or the relays went away |
| `error` | nothing has ever answered. Usually an address that reaches no device |

`onkyo` uses the same five for the same reasons, reading them off its sockets:
`connecting` while a receiver has not been tried yet, `online` when every bound
one is connected and has answered, `degraded` when some are, `offline` when none
are now though some have been, and `error` when every one has been tried and
none has ever answered — the same operator mistake, reported by the same word,
whichever provider it lands on.

`tuya` says the same states about the cloud rather than the relays:
`unconfigured` until credentials exist, `connecting` during the first contact,
`online` while sweeps succeed, `offline` on network failure, and `error` when
the cloud rejects the credentials or the cloud project's quota has expired —
which is what an expired IoT Core trial looks like. `offline` and `error`
stale only this provider's tiles.

> `DESIGN.md` §4.1 also specifies a standalone `GET /providers` carrying the
> same entries without the device health around them. This firmware does not
> serve it: nothing needs it, because `/status` and the WebSocket already carry
> the list. Asking for it returns `404 not_found`.

`GET /resources?provider=<id>` returns `{"resources": [ … ]}` in the normalized
vocabulary below. It is the bounded runtime store: Home Assistant contains only
entities referenced by the active dashboard, `direct` contains only bound
resources published since boot, and `shelly` contains what the poller last read
from the devices the dashboard names. `tuya` is the exception: it returns the
cloud account's whole mappable device list for the picker, cached for a minute,
because that list is the only place a device's app name exists. The editor
obtains the full HA picker catalog through `/ha/catalog`, assembles it in
browser memory once, shares the cache between tile pickers and refreshes it in
the background. Missing, unknown and unconfigured providers answer `400
provider_required`, `404 provider_not_found` and `409 provider_unconfigured`.

### Normalized resources

Every provider produces the same shape, and this is the whole of what a
component sees:

```json
{
  "provider": "direct",
  "resource": "living-room",
  "kind": "light",
  "name": "Living room",
  "area": "Downstairs",
  "available": true,
  "state": {"power": "on", "brightness": 62},
  "capabilities": {
    "toggle": true,
    "set_power": true,
    "set_brightness": {"min": 0, "max": 100}
  }
}
```

`provider`, `resource`, `kind`, `available` and `state` are required; `name`,
`area` and `capabilities` are optional, and absent capabilities mean read-only.
A snapshot always replaces the previous one in full.

`kind` is semantic rather than a native domain name:

| `kind` | `state` | Actions when advertised |
|--------|---------|-------------------------|
| `light` | `power` is `on`/`off`; optional `brightness`, `color_temperature` | `toggle`, `set_power`, `set_brightness`, `set_color_temperature` |
| `cover` | position and movement | `toggle`, `open`, `stop`, `close` |
| `sensor` | `value`, optional `unit`, `measurement` and `category` | none |
| `scene` | stateless | `activate` |

A sensor's two optional descriptions answer different questions.
`measurement` — `temperature`, `humidity`, `pressure` or `power` — says what
magnitude the number is and decides how the tile formats it. `category` says
what the reading is about and decides its icon: `temperature`, `humidity`,
`pressure`, `power`, `illuminance`, `air_quality`, `gas`, `sound`, `speed`,
`battery`, `connectivity`, `door`, `window`, `garage`, `motion`, `occupancy`,
`moisture`, `smoke`, `lock`, `plug`, `problem` or `running`. A door contact has
the second and not the first. Either may be omitted, and a name this firmware
does not know is ignored rather than refused.

The four measurements are also categories and imply them, so a snapshot that
states only `measurement` is read back from `GET /resources` with the matching
`category` filled in. State `category` explicitly to say something
`measurement` cannot — a battery percentage, a leak detector, a door.

An unavailable resource keeps its last values and renders stale. A provider
going `offline` stales only its own resources: an unreachable Home Assistant
must not dim tiles fed by a script.

### `GET /status`

```json
{
  "network": {"mode": "sta", "ssid": "home", "ip": "192.168.1.42",
              "sta_ssid": "home", "ipv4": {"mode": "dhcp"}, "last_error": null},
  "providers": [{"id": "direct", "status": "degraded", "resource_count": 0},
                {"id": "ha", "status": "unconfigured", "resource_count": 0},
                {"id": "shelly", "status": "unconfigured", "resource_count": 0},
                {"id": "onkyo", "status": "unconfigured", "resource_count": 0},
                {"id": "tuya", "status": "unconfigured", "resource_count": 0}],
  "rssi": -54, "uptime_s": 120, "heap_free": 294631,
  "lvgl_heap_free": null, "lvgl_heap_total": null, "lvgl_frag_pct": null,
  "reset_reason": "power_on", "reboot_count": 3,
  "resource_count": 0, "storage_reset": false
}
```

The three LVGL figures are `null` before display bring-up rather than zero,
which would look like an exhausted allocator. `storage_reset` says boot recovery
erased corrupt NVS or reformatted the filesystem, which is a different thing
from a panel that was simply never configured.

### Home Assistant

```json
{"url": "http://homeassistant.local:8123", "token": "<long-lived access token>"}
```

`204` only after the credentials have been tested against the instance and
persisted atomically; existing working credentials survive every failed request.
Refusals are `400` (`url_required`, `token_required`, `url_too_long`,
`token_too_long`, `bad_url`), `422 ha_auth_invalid`, `502 ha_unreachable`,
`503 ha_busy` and `500` (`store_failed`, `reload_failed`). Any HTTP redirect on
the WebSocket URL is refused before the token is sent — the URL you configured
is the credential boundary, not the first hop toward one.

`GET /ha/discover` returns what the local network advertises as
`{"instances": [{"name": …, "uuid": …, "url": …}]}`. An empty result is normal:
multicast DNS does not always cross a VLAN, and manual entry remains available.

`GET /ha` returns `{"configured":true,"url":"http://…"}` or an unconfigured
response with a null URL. It never returns the long-lived token. `DELETE /ha`
answers `204`, removes that token and clears HA runtime state.

The editor fetches the full configuration catalog in four stages: `entities`,
`devices`, `areas`, then `states`. `POST /ha/catalog` with `{"stage":"entities"}`
returns a request id. `GET /ha/catalog?request=<id>` returns
`{"status":"pending"}` until it can return the corresponding HA WebSocket
result. Only one small response is resident on the ESP32 at a time; the browser
joins the stages and caches the normalized catalog. Normal panel operation does
not use this route and subscribes only to configured entity ids.

### Tuya

The `tuya` provider drives Tuya and Smart Life devices through the official
Tuya cloud rather than the LAN: the panel signs its requests (HMAC-SHA256 over
HTTPS) and polls bound devices every five seconds. Configuring it is the one
thing that makes the panel talk to a third party's servers, and nothing is
sent to them until it succeeds.

```json
{"region": "eu", "access_id": "…", "secret": "…", "uid": "…"}
```

`region` is one of `us`, `eu`, `cn`, `in`, `ueaz` or `weaz`; `uid` is the
Smart Life / Tuya Smart app account linked to a cloud project at
iot.tuya.com. `204` only after the credentials have been tested against the
Tuya cloud — a token fetch and a device listing — and persisted; existing
working credentials survive every failed request. Refusals are `400`
(`region_required`, `region_unknown`, `access_id_required`,
`access_id_too_long`, `secret_required`, `secret_too_long`, `uid_required`,
`uid_too_long`, plus the usual body errors), `422` (`tuya_auth_failed`,
`tuya_quota`), `502 tuya_unreachable`, `503 tuya_busy` and `500
store_failed`. `tuya_quota` is the cloud project's plan — the free IoT Core
trial expires — and the same condition later turns a working provider's
status to `error`.

`GET /tuya` returns `{"configured":true,"region":"eu","uid":"…"}` or an
unconfigured response with null fields. It never returns the Access ID or the
Access Secret. `DELETE /tuya` answers `204`, erases the credentials and stops
the polling.

### External API keys

`GET /integration-keys` returns only non-secret metadata:
`{"keys":[{"id":"…","name":"Node-RED"}]}`. `POST /integration-keys` with
`{"name":"Node-RED"}` creates one and returns `201` with `id`, `name` and
`token`. That plaintext is shown once; NVS stores only its SHA-256 digest. Up to
four keys may exist. `DELETE /integration-keys?id=<id>` revokes one, answers
`204`, and immediately closes an active WebSocket authenticated with it.

### `POST /wifi`

```json
{"ssid": "home", "password": "…", "admin_pin": "1234",
 "setup_password": "optional WPA2 passphrase", "ipv4": {"mode": "dhcp"}}

{"ssid": "home", "password": "…",
 "ipv4": {"mode": "static", "address": "192.168.1.42/24",
          "gateway": "192.168.1.1", "dns": ["192.168.1.1"]}}
```

Answers `202`, and **the outcome appears on the panel, not in the response.**
There is one radio: at the instant the station associates, the setup access
point moves to the router's channel and drops the browser that submitted the
form. Polling for a result from that browser is not something that can be made
to work, so the screen reports success with the address-only QR, and
failure with a named reason.

An absent or `null` password keeps the stored one, but only when the SSID is
unchanged; that is what lets a setup page correct a failed static address
without handling the secret. An explicit empty string means an open network and
erases what was stored. An absent `ipv4` means `dhcp`, and an explicit `dhcp` is
a request to stop using a stored static address rather than merely a request not
to set one.

A static address is on trial when it is submitted: the gateway is proved over
ARP, and no confirmation within about fifteen seconds reverts to DHCP, keeps the
configuration stored and marked failed, and prints the reason. Once confirmed it
is sticky.

Refusals are `400` unless noted: `ssid_required`, `ssid_too_long`,
`password_too_long`, `truncated`, `bad_ipv4`, `bad_ipv4_mode`, `bad_address`,
`bad_gateway`, `bad_dns`, `store_failed` (500).

`GET /wifi/scan` serves a cache and says how old it is, because scanning makes
the access point unresponsive while it runs. `age_s` is `null` when no sweep has
ever been taken, which is not the same as a room with no networks in it.
`?rescan=1` sweeps first.

```json
{"networks": [{"ssid": "home", "rssi": -54, "channel": 6, "auth": "wpa2"}], "age_s": 12}
```

### Device controls

`POST /mode` takes `{"mode": "normal"|"edit"}`; edit mode falls back to normal
after 60 s without a client. `POST /identify` and `POST /factory_reset` take no
body and refuse one with `unexpected_body`. All three answer `204`. A factory
reset erases NVS and LittleFS, rotates authentication state, answers, and reboots.

### `POST /ota/upload`

The body is a raw `.bin`, and curl needs `-H 'Expect:'` to send one: it adds
`Expect: 100-continue` to a body this size, the panel's HTTP server never
answers that, and curl then waits out its own timeout before sending anything.
On success:

```json
{"partition": "ota_1", "bytes": 927040, "version": "1.0.0"}
```

The `200` arrives before the reboot, because afterwards there is nobody left to
answer. `version` is read out of the image that was just written, not the one
still running — "did the file I meant to send arrive" is the question a flash
asks. The new image gets one boot to answer `GET /info`; if it does not, the
bootloader returns to the previous slot on its own.

Refusals: `not_an_image`, `invalid_image`, `truncated`, `pending_verify`,
`no_ota_partition`, `empty_body`, `too_large`, `out_of_memory`. None of them
changes what the panel boots.

`tools/ota/upload.sh` is this endpoint with the checks worth having around it.
This is a development mechanism: no manifest, no versioning, no HTTPS. The
release channel below is the other one.

### Firmware updates

```json
{
  "current": "1.0.0",
  "manifest_url": "https://mateuszsikora.github.io/slate/ota/manifest.json",
  "scheduled": true,
  "state": "idle",
  "checked_s_ago": 3600,
  "available": {"version": "1.1.0", "url": "https://…/firmware/1.1.0/slate.bin",
                "sha256": "…"},
  "error": null,
  "progress": null
}
```

`GET /update` is the whole channel as the panel sees it. `state` is `idle`,
`checking`, `downloading` or `installed`; `progress` is `{"received": …,
"total": …}` while an image is arriving and `null` otherwise. `available` is an
**offer**, not a staged image: the panel has read a few hundred bytes of
manifest and compared them with itself. `error` is the last failure in the
vocabulary below, and survives beside an offer that is still valid — a check
that could not reach the server did not make the release stop existing.

Two fields say whether the panel looks on its own, and they are not the same
question. `manifest_url` is `null` on a build with no channel, which is what
`-DSLATE_UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL='""'` produces; that panel has nowhere to look and
no setting can give it one. `scheduled` is `false` on a panel that has a channel
and was told to stop using it, through `POST /update/settings` below — the daily
request is gone, everything else about the channel is still there. A build with
no channel reports `scheduled` as `false` too, because it is the answer to "does
this panel check on its own", and `manifest_url` is what tells the two apart.

The manifest is [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) §11.4's five fields, published by the
release workflow beside the browser installer:

```json
{"version": "1.1.0", "board": "waveshare-s3-touch-7",
 "url": "https://…/firmware/1.1.0/slate.bin", "sha256": "…", "min_schema": 1}
```

A release is offered only when `board` is this panel's model, `min_schema` is no
higher than its `schema_max`, `url` is `https://`, and `version` is newer than
the running one. A running version that is not `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-suffix]` is a
development build, and any release is newer than one of those.

`POST /update/check` and `POST /update/install` both answer `202 Accepted` with
`{}` and do the work afterwards — the panel serves HTTP from one task, and a TLS
fetch on it would stop the rest of the API for seconds. Poll `GET /update` for
the outcome. `check` takes no body. `install` takes `{"version": "1.1.0"}`,
which must be the version the panel is currently offering, and an absent body
installs whatever that is. What the check buys is narrow and worth stating
exactly: a daily check landing between the moment a client read the offer and
the moment somebody pressed the button cannot silently redirect the install to a
different version. It is not a promise that the accepted release still exists —
the panel installs from the URL it cached at its last check, and a channel that
has since moved on answers `release_gone` (see below).

The download is verified before it can boot. The image's header must be an
ESP32-S3 application image, its own version must be the one the manifest
promised, and its SHA-256 must be the manifest's — checked over the stream, so
the boot partition is moved only for an image that passed. A failure here costs
the *other* firmware slot and never the running one, exactly as
`POST /ota/upload` does. The new image then gets one boot to answer `GET /info`
before the bootloader takes it back.

`POST /update/settings` takes `{"scheduled": false}` and answers `204`. It is a
device setting in NVS, not part of the configuration document — §10 makes that
file something people export, import and share between panels, and whether *this*
wall talks to the internet is not a property that should travel with a dashboard.
It survives a reboot and does not survive a factory reset, which erases NVS along
with the credentials and the PIN; the default is on.

What it switches off is the schedule and only the schedule. `POST /update/check`
works exactly as before while it is off — an explicit check is a request, not a
schedule — and so does `POST /update/install`, on an offer the panel is still
holding. Turning it back on resumes the daily check without a reboot, and checks
straight away if a day has passed meanwhile. A build with no channel refuses this
route `503 no_channel`, like the other two `POST`s: there is no schedule to have
an opinion about.

Refusals from the three `POST`s: `409` (`busy`, `no_update`, `version_mismatch`),
`503 no_channel`, `500 store_failed`, and the usual body errors
(`unexpected_body`, `empty_body`, `invalid_json`, `invalid_version`,
`invalid_scheduled`, `too_large`, `truncated`). Failures reported in `error`:
`offline`, `unreachable`, `no_release`, `release_gone`, `manifest_invalid`,
`board_mismatch`, `schema_too_new`, `insecure_url`, `download_failed`,
`checksum_mismatch`, `not_an_image`, `version_mismatch`, `invalid_image`,
`too_large`, `no_ota_partition`, `pending_verify`, `ota_failed`,
`out_of_memory`.

Three of those are about the channel and are worth telling apart, because they
look alike from a browser and are not alike at all. `unreachable` is a host that
did not answer. `no_release` is a manifest that is not there — a channel with
nothing published on it. A build re-pointed at a channel of its own with
`-DSLATE_UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL`, and a deployment that has not landed yet, both
look like this, and neither is a fault. `release_gone` is the image URL of a
cached offer answering `404`: the deployment carries one release at a time, so
an offer this panel read before the newest tag names a file that is no longer
published. The panel treats that as its own cue to look again, so the
current release is normally on screen by the time somebody reads the message.

Nothing on this path is automatic except the daily check, the check downloads
nothing, and the daily check is the one thing here that can be switched off.
Installation is always a request, and always ends in a restart the person who
asked for it chose the moment of.

### `GET /coredump`

The only route whose success is not JSON: `200 application/octet-stream` with
the dump exactly as the panic handler wrote it, which is what
`esp-coredump --core-format raw` and `idf.py coredump-info` both read.
`tools/coredump/fetch.sh` is the host side. Refusals are `404 no_coredump` — a
healthy panel — and `500 corrupt_coredump`, `coredump_read_failed`,
`out_of_memory`. A transfer that stops part-way has no error document, because
the `200` has already gone; a short body is always a failed transfer and never a
short dump.

## WebSocket

```
ws://<address>/api/v1/ws
```

The upgrade carries no credential — a token in the query string would land in
access logs, and requiring a header would exclude the browser WebSocket API. The
client authenticates with its first frame, within five seconds:

```json
{"type": "auth", "token": "<32-character session or External API credential>"}
```

With a device-session credential, `{"type":"auth_ok"}` is followed by the
retained log backlog and a current `status` frame. An External API key receives
only `auth_ok` and direct-provider `action` frames after it attaches; it cannot
receive logs, status or editor events. A bad credential, a malformed first frame
or silence for five seconds gets `{"type":"auth_invalid"}` and a 1008 close.
Nothing else is accepted before `auth_ok`.

Device → client:

```json
{"type": "status",   "providers": {"direct": "online", "ha": "unconfigured",
                                   "shelly": "online", "onkyo": "online",
                                   "tuya": "error"},
                     "provider_reasons": {"tuya": "quota"},
                     "wifi": -54, "heap_free": 142000,
                     "lvgl_heap_free": 2088632, "lvgl_frag_pct": 1}
{"type": "log",      "level": "warn", "msg": "resource direct:living-room unavailable"}
{"type": "reloaded", "schema": 1, "tiles": 7}
{"type": "action",   "id": 42, "provider": "direct", "resource": "living-room",
                     "action": "toggle", "params": {}}
```

Client → device:

```json
{"type": "ping"}
{"type": "mode", "mode": "edit"}
{"type": "provider_attach", "provider": "direct"}
{"type": "action_result", "id": 42, "success": true}
```

`status` is the device's 15-second heartbeat. The JSON `ping` above is the
client's; WebSocket control frames stay a transport mechanism with no
application meaning. Sixty seconds without a client ping leaves edit mode, and
does not disconnect a diagnostics client that is otherwise healthy.

## The direct provider

`direct` is how anything that is not Home Assistant drives the same components:
a shell script, a Node-RED flow, a test fixture. It is always present, uses a
named External API key created by an administrator, and is the reference adapter for the
provider contract — there is no broker, callback URL or discovery protocol in
it, deliberately.

A round trip has three parts.

**1. Bind something to it.** The store holds only resources the active
dashboard references, so publish before binding and there is nowhere to put it:

```json
{"id": "t1", "type": "light", "pos": [0, 0], "size": [2, 1],
 "binding": {"provider": "direct", "resource": "living-room"}}
```

**2. Publish state over HTTP.** The body is a normalized snapshot without
`provider`, which the endpoint fixes to `direct` — a body that could name its
own provider is a body that could write into the Home Assistant half of the
store:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://192.168.1.42/api/v1/direct/state \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLATE_API_KEY" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"resource":"living-room","kind":"light","name":"Living room",
          "available":true,"state":{"power":"on","brightness":62},
          "capabilities":{"toggle":true,"set_brightness":{"min":0,"max":100}}}'
```

`202 {"resource":"living-room"}` means accepted and enqueued. The refusals are
worth reading rather than retrying: `404 resource_not_bound` (nothing binds that
id, which is also the bound that stops a LAN client filling PSRAM),
`409 kind_mismatch` (the tile expects a different kind), `400 invalid_state`.
None of them disturbs the last confirmed value.

`tools/direct/publish.sh` is this request with the key kept out of the process
list.

**3. Answer actions over the WebSocket.** One authenticated client attaches:

```json
{"type": "provider_attach", "provider": "direct"}
```

A second attachment gets `{"type":"error","error":"provider_busy"}`, because two
processes must not both operate the same light; re-attaching from the client
that already holds it is not a second process and is not an error. There is no
acknowledgement frame — attaching moves the provider from `degraded` to
`online`, and the `status` frame that follows carries exactly the fact the
client was asking about.

From then on a tap arrives as an `action` frame and is answered with
`action_result`. **Answering is not confirming.** `success: true` acknowledges
delivery; what clears the tile's pending state is the next published snapshot
showing the new value. A consumer that answers and never publishes leaves every
tap reverting after three seconds. `success: false` reverts immediately, which
is the better failure — a detached consumer fails actions at once rather than
making the panel wait out the timeout.

`tools/direct/agent.py` is a complete consumer in the standard library alone:
attach, receive, apply, answer, publish. Run it against a panel with one bound
light and every tap on that tile round-trips through it.

## The Shelly provider

`shelly` is the panel reaching devices itself. There is no endpoint on this
page for it, and that is the design rather than an omission: its configuration
is the set of resource ids the active dashboard binds, so publishing a
dashboard is the whole of setting it up.

```json
{"id": "t1", "type": "light", "pos": [0, 0], "size": [1, 1],
 "binding": {"provider": "shelly", "resource": "192.168.1.51/switch:0"}}
```

The grammar is `<host>/<role>:<index>`. `host` is an address or an mDNS name and
is used verbatim; `role` is one of:

| `role` | `kind` | Reads |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `switch` | `light` | the relay. `toggle` and `set_power` |
| `power` | `sensor` | instantaneous draw in W |
| `voltage` | `sensor` | mains in V |
| `temperature` | `sensor` | that channel's, in °C — on a single-board relay it is the device's |

`index` is the channel: `switch:0` and `switch:1` are the two sides of a
Plus 2PM, and a single-channel relay has only `:0`.

Both Shelly generations answer to the same ids. `GET /shelly` on the device
carries `gen` only on the newer ones, so the panel probes once per host and
picks `/rpc/Switch.*` or `/relay/N` itself — a dashboard never says which
generation it is talking to. The probe is repeated after a device stops
answering, so a relay swapped for a different model at the same address is
picked up rather than driven with the old dialect.

A role the device does not measure — `voltage` on an unmetered relay — never
produces a value, so its tile keeps the placeholder naming `provider:resource`
rather than showing a zero. That is the same rendering as a binding whose host
does not answer at all, and for the same reason: a normalized snapshot has no
spelling for "no value", so a resource with no reading is one the provider does
not publish. A resource that *has* been read and then goes unreachable is
published unavailable with its last value, and renders stale.

Reading it back is `GET /resources?provider=shelly`:

```json
{"resources": [
  {"provider": "shelly", "resource": "192.168.1.51/switch:0", "kind": "light",
   "available": true, "state": {"power": "on"},
   "capabilities": {"toggle": true, "set_power": true}},
  {"provider": "shelly", "resource": "192.168.1.51/power:0", "kind": "sensor",
   "available": true,
   "state": {"value": 3.2, "unit": "W", "measurement": "power"}}
]}
```

Devices are polled every five seconds, and a tap re-reads its own device at once
rather than waiting for the next sweep. A device that stops answering marks its
own resources unavailable and keeps their last values, so one unplugged relay
does not blank the rest of the page.

There is no authentication in this path. Shelly devices ship open on a LAN, and
a panel that reaches one is a panel already on the same network as the relay it
is switching.

## The Onkyo provider

`onkyo` drives an Onkyo or Integra receiver over eISCP, and it is the one
provider the panel does not have to ask. The receiver pushes its own changes —
somebody turning the volume knob on the front panel produces a frame — so a tile
is current without polling for it.

Configured the same way as `shelly`: the binding carries the address.

```json
{"id": "t1", "type": "light", "pos": [0, 0], "size": [2, 1],
 "binding": {"provider": "onkyo", "resource": "192.168.1.60/main"},
 "label": "Onkyo", "icon": "volume-high"}
```

Size it **2×1**. The 2×2 variant draws the same slider but captions it
`BRIGHTNESS` and adds a colour-temperature row — correct for a light, wrong for
a receiver.

| `role` | `kind` | Is |
|--------|--------|----|
| `main` | `light` | the receiver. `power` is its power; `brightness` is the volume. `toggle`, `set_power`, `set_brightness` |
| `input` | `sensor` | the selected input, by name — `Net`, `FM`, `CD` |
| `volume` | `sensor` | the number the receiver's own display shows, or `Muted` |
| `input:<code>` | `scene` | `activate` selects that input, powering the receiver on if needed |
| `mute` | `scene` | `activate` toggles mute |

`<code>` is eISCP's own two-hex-digit selector, not a name: `2b` is NET, `24` is
FM, `23` is CD, `2e` is Bluetooth, `20` is TV/Tape. A receiver's own remote and
manual use the same list, and the panel does not keep a vocabulary it does not
own in step with the vendor's.

**Volume is the percentage, one for one.** A TX-8270 reports `MVL56` — 86 — while
its own `NRI` claims `volmax="82"`, so neither number is reliably the scale. The
panel sends the percentage as the receiver's own volume value and lets the
receiver clamp what it cannot do.

The slider is therefore an **absolute** volume with no ceiling of its own:
dragging the tile's slider to the top asks for the loudest thing the receiver can do,
the way turning the knob all the way would. That is a deliberate choice rather
than an oversight — a wall panel that quietly refused the top of its own slider
would be harder to explain than one that does what it looks like it does — but
it is worth knowing before the first tap.

Nothing is published for a receiver that has not answered yet, so its tiles keep
the placeholder naming `provider:resource` until the first frame arrives — the
same rule `shelly` follows, for the same reason. A receiver that goes away is
published unavailable with its last values and renders stale.

Every resource carries a `name`, which matters most for `input:<code>`: a 4×1
scene bar has one `label` for the whole bar, so without it each button falls back
to its resource id and a row of addresses appears on the wall.

**`mute` is a scene, so it flashes and shows nothing.** Bind `volume` beside it —
it reads `Muted` while mute is on, and is the only place the state is visible;
the `light` tile's slider has nowhere to put it.

There is no authentication in eISCP, and none here. A receiver on the LAN
answers whoever connects to it, which is equally true of its remote control.

## The Tuya provider

`tuya` is the panel driving Tuya and Smart Life devices itself, through the
official Tuya cloud rather than the LAN. Like `shelly` it needs nothing else
running; unlike it, the traffic leaves the local network, and the provider has
credentials — the endpoints are [`GET`, `POST` and `DELETE /tuya`](#tuya)
above, and nothing is sent to the cloud before they succeed.

The resource id is the device's own Tuya device id, about 22 characters of
hex:

```json
{"id": "t1", "type": "light", "pos": [0, 0], "size": [1, 1],
 "binding": {"provider": "tuya", "resource": "vdevo16847893501234ab"}}
```

There is no grammar beyond that: no host, no role, no index. The one piece of
syntax is the humidity suffix — a temperature-and-humidity sensor is two
resources, the bare device id for temperature and `<id>/humidity` for the
second reading.

Actions are the normalized vocabulary: lights take `toggle`, `set_power`,
`set_brightness` and `set_color_temperature` as the device's functions spec
allows, covers take `open`, `stop`, `close` and `set_position`, and sensors
are read-only. A command is acknowledged by delivery, and the panel re-reads
that device at once, so a tap's pending state clears on the next snapshot
rather than at the next sweep.

The picker catalog is `GET /resources?provider=tuya`:

```json
{"catalog_state": "ready", "resources": [
  {"provider": "tuya", "resource": "vdevo16847893501234ab", "kind": "light",
   "name": "Hall", "available": true, "state": {"power": "off"}},
  {"provider": "tuya", "resource": "vdevo16847893505678cd/humidity",
   "kind": "sensor", "name": "Bedroom humidity", "available": true,
   "state": {"value": 0}}
]}
```

`catalog_state` is `empty`, `loading`, `ready`, or `error`. A cold `empty` or
`loading` response has no resources and tells the picker to poll with bounded
backoff. A stale refresh remains `loading` while retaining the last complete
resource list. `ready` may legitimately contain an empty list. `error` keeps a
previous complete list when one exists, never a partial replacement, and lets
the picker offer an explicit retry.

A catalog entry carries what the device list knows — id, kind, the app's name
— and a placeholder state, not a live reading: the device list carries no data
point values, the picker renders none, and capabilities arrive with the first
snapshot a bound resource publishes, which is what a tile reads.

It lists the devices the panel can map — lights, covers, temperature and
humidity sensors, and metered plugs reporting power — under the names the
Tuya app gave them. A dual sensor appears twice, bare id and `<id>/humidity`.
Devices in other categories appear nowhere: not in the catalog, not bound.
Catalog entries carry a placeholder state; the honest values arrive with the
first published snapshot once a tile binds.

Bound devices are polled every five seconds. A network failure marks the
provider `offline` and its tiles stale; rejected credentials or an expired
cloud quota mark it `error` — the states are the same vocabulary
[`/status`](#providers-and-get-resources) reports for every provider.

## What is deliberately absent

- **No HTTPS.** A self-signed certificate on an ESP32 is a worse experience than
  its absence on a local network, and the threat model here is a LAN.
- **No accounts, no cloud, no telemetry.** The browser talks to the device.
  The `tuya` provider is the one deliberate exception on the device's own
  side: its signed requests to the Tuya cloud are what that provider is, and
  they exist only while it is configured.
- **No general API rate limiting or origin allow-list** until a concrete
  scenario needs one. PIN attempts are rate-limited separately.
- **Upstream secrets only go in.** The Home Assistant token, Tuya Access ID and
  Access Secret, and the WiFi passphrase are never returned. `GET /tuya`
  deliberately returns the non-secret region and account UID so the editor can
  show the current connection — and the
  passphrase never enters the configuration document either. The two
  intentional credential responses are
  narrow: `/session` returns the internal credential to the current page, and a
  newly created External API key is returned once.
