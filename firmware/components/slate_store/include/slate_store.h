/*
 * Slate — persistent store.
 *
 * DESIGN.md §4.3 (device token), §6.3 (partition layout), §12 (secrets).
 *
 * Two kinds of storage, chosen by what the data is rather than by how big it
 * is:
 *
 *   NVS       secrets and settings — the device token, the Home Assistant
 *             credentials, and from #8/#55 the station credentials. Small,
 *             written rarely, must survive an update.
 *   LittleFS  the UI configuration and, from M6, the editor's static files.
 *
 * Both partitions sit outside `ota_0` and `ota_1` (§6.3), which is what lets
 * §11.4 promise that a firmware update does not take the configuration and the
 * tokens with it.
 *
 * This is a component rather than part of `main` because everything in M1
 * consumes it: #8 and #55 keep the station credentials here, #10 authenticates
 * against the device token, #11 refuses an upload without it.
 *
 *
 * ERROR VOCABULARY
 *
 * One spelling per condition, whichever partition the value lives on — the
 * same principle §4.1 applies to the network error strings, for the same
 * reason. NVS's own error codes do not escape this header:
 *
 *   ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND      the key or the file is not set. Usually not a
 *                          failure — a factory-fresh panel with no
 *                          configuration is §6.5's `error` mode, not a fault.
 *   ESP_ERR_INVALID_SIZE   the caller's buffer is too small, or the value
 *                          exceeds a documented limit. Use
 *                          slate_store_str_size() to size a retry.
 *   ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG    a NULL or nonsensical argument.
 *
 *
 * THREADING
 *
 * slate_store_init() must be called once, from app_main, before any other
 * function here and before WiFi comes up (see slate_store_set_rf_active()).
 *
 * Afterwards every function here is safe to call from any task, with one
 * exception that cannot be fixed with a lock and so is stated rather than
 * hidden: slate_store_factory_reset() tears the filesystem down and wipes NVS
 * underneath the whole system. It serialises against this component, but it
 * invalidates NVS handles other ESP-IDF components cached long ago — the WiFi
 * driver's among them — so the device MUST be rebooted afterwards. See the
 * note on that function.
