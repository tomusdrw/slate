/*
 * Slate — provider-neutral state store and subscription contract.
 *
 * DESIGN.md ADR-3, §5.1 (the provider boundary), §5.2 (normalized resources
 * and state), §3.3 (bindings), §6.2 (memory), §6.4 (the rebuild), §7.5 (what a
 * component has to be able to render).
 *
 * This is the middle of the topology in §2 and the reason the rest of it can
 * stay ignorant of each other. A provider writes normalized snapshots in; the
 * UI runtime reads normalized values out; neither holds a pointer to the other.
 * ADR-3's promise — "a component asks to `toggle` a light; it never constructs
 * a Home Assistant `call_service` frame" — is only enforceable if there is one
 * place where the vocabulary is defined and nothing provider-specific is
 * expressible. This header is that place, and its whole test is that nothing in
 * it names a transport, a domain, an entity or a service.
 *
 * The store deliberately does NOT own:
 *
 *   actions          #18. Dispatch, optimistic state and the 3 s revert are the
 *                    action bus's; the capability bits below are what it
 *                    validates against, and they live here because they arrive
 *                    in the same snapshot as the state.
 *   the LVGL tree    #20. The store notifies; it never draws, and §6.1 keeps
 *                    every LVGL call on one task.
 *   transports       #74 and #16. A provider parses its own payloads and hands
 *                    over the result — §5.6 says the HA adapter expands its
 *                    compressed diffs before the store sees anything, which is
 *                    the same rule stated from the other side.
 *   discovery        §5.7's picker catalog is much larger than the active
 *                    configuration and lives in the adapter (§6.2). The store
 *                    holds only what the dashboard binds.
 *
 *
 * WHAT IS BOUND IS WHAT EXISTS
 *
 * §5.1 makes the active configuration the memory bound: "the runtime state
 * store holds only resources referenced by the active configuration". So the
 * binding set is not a filter applied to a general store — it *is* the store's
 * allocation, replaced whole by slate_state_bind() on every rebuild. A resource
 * nobody binds has nowhere to be written, which is what stops an unbounded LAN
 * client filling PSRAM (§5.4) without a rate limiter or a quota.
 *
 *
 * THREADING
 *
 * slate_state_init() runs once from app_main. Afterwards:
 *
 *   slate_state_bind()      one task only, the UI runtime's. It is the
 *                           configuration lifecycle of §6.4 and there is one of
 *                           those.
 *   everything else         any task. Providers publish from their own.
 *
 * Reads copy. A component holding a pointer into the table across a rebuild is
 * exactly the use-after-free §6.4 invites, so the API does not hand one out.
 *
 * Before slate_state_init(), and after it has failed, every function that can
 * report an error reports ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE. A store that could not come up
 * is a dashboard that cannot hold values, which §6.5 has a mode for; it is not
 * a reason for the panel to stop answering the API.

 * carries the current value and each resource appears at most once.

 * `fn` runs outside the store's lock, so it may read the store and publish into
 * it. It must not call slate_state_bind(): the drain walks the table by index,
 * and a rebuild underneath it would renumber the entries it has not reached —
 * some delivered twice, some not at all. A rebuild is what the drain feeds
 * anyway, so it belongs after the loop rather than inside it.
 *
